Carve it like an arch now make it jump

Tight in a skirt
And you like to flirt

Pull up your skirt
Pull your thongs to the side
One letter get them ready to ride

Oh baby you drive me crazy
With that fever you burn me up now
Just mind the heat
Got yourself sticky
So freaky
Just let me bust my creep on top of the key?
He and me meet on top of the beat?
I'm gonna take this from going coast to coast
Make you get wet in your low clothes?
Gonna toss you over bout to break your back
Take your nose straps get to it whack?
I like the way you shake them thighs
I like the way you got sex in your eyes
Now hows about me and you
Do what your mamma told you not to do
Like 68, 69
Get behind look bump and grind
It's about that time
You're just so damn fine
Girl you're gonna make me lose my mind
We got spirit yah yah yah 2x
