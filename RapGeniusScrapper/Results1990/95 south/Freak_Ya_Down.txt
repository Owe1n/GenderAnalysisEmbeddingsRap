Freak Ya Down Lyrics
(Ahh, freak out)
(Freak out)
(Freak out)
(Ahh, freak out)
(Ahh, freak out)

Come on, come on, what's up, yo?
We done went to the picture show
Ate food, and rolled around
It's about time for you to come on down
Don't take this the wrong way
I guess what I'm tryna say
Is since I met you
I been wantin' to get next to you
So let's go back to my place
And put on a lil' Babyface
Eat a lil' somethin' sweet
Then ease on in the sheets
Don't try to flodge
I know you went here for a body massage
Let me rub ya down
And just before I love ya down, I'll bring out the whipped cream
Freak ya out, and make ya scream
Then kiss you on ya lips
Go downtown, flip the strip
So we can do this my way
Or Miss Priss, you can hit the highway
'Cause today, we speakin' on
Me and you gettin' our freak on
What ya waitin' on? Pick up the phone
Call me up so we can get our freak on

That's the way (Uh-huh, uh-huh), I wanna freak ya down (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
That's the way (Uh-huh, uh-huh), I wanna freak ya down (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
That's the way (Uh-huh, uh-huh), I wanna freak ya down (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
That's the way (Uh-huh, uh-huh), I wanna freak ya down (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

I wanna freak ya down (I like that sound)
So what you want me to do? (Go downtown)
We can wine and dine (Lil' bump n' grind)
95 South is down with sixty-nine
I wanna freak ya down (I like that sound)
So what you want me to do? (Go downtown)
We can wine and dine (Lil' bump n' grind)
95 South is down with sixty-nine

It's time to freak out, so what you gon' do?
Shake a lil' somethin', hope you do
So don't be wastin' time
What's up with the bump n' grind?
All night long, bring ya toothbrush and gown, 'cause you ain't goin' home
And let's getcha-getcha
I wanna hit ya, and get with ya
So write ya number down girl, so I can take ya around the world
And when I hit ya
Call me back and I'll meet ya, uh
At the twenty-dollar Mo', uh, 'cause I ain't no joke
And when it comes to the neighborhood plumber
I lay pipe and I love ya
'Cause I like doin' freaky stuff, and a lil' bit of sneaky stuff
Like lickin' ya in, lickin' ya out
Gettin' the skins and then gettin' ya out
'Cause I gots to get mine
'Til the tank out of time
So I'm glad to meet ya
Come on down, and I'll freak ya
