1st Stanza of verses: 
It's tightwork when I'm rolling in my Cadillac
Getting some slow head
Sippin' on Koniac
It's tightwork when you rolling from Duval and Dade
With a pocket full of bread on a escapade
It's tightwork when you leaning in ya Coupe Deville
Twenty, twen, twen with the wood grain steering wheel
It's tightwork when we put that in yo life
And then we turn around and put something in yo
It's tightwork when you holla out we ready
Laid back smoked out off in the Chevy
It's tightwork when you left right left step
Forward march, Tight 2 Def
It's tightwork, when ya boy pushing dat weight
You drove wit bout 4 and bring back 8
You might also likeIt's tightwork when ya ride for ya jigga
Die for ya jigga, you know we stay tight for our jigga's

2nd Stanza of verses 
You know what's tightwork them ??? black girls
Dem red bone girls, dem bowlegged girls
It's tightwork, when you do a ??? in her draws
And now she in the kitchen cooking grits in her draws
It's tightwork when you bring a ho to the studio
Make her do tricks to be in the video
It's tightwork when you tell her ay oh, ay oh
When she drop dat big booty on down to the flo'
It's tightwork when you got a pair of gators on
Step off in the club and you got dem broad's head gone
It's tightwork when you off in the mall ballin'
Shot callin', playa just ballin'
Now damn, y'all tightwork when y'all ball
Got me riding on this track representing Duval
It's tightwork, when you caught a head round three
With two of her friends and you split all three

DAT'S DAT SHIT RIGHT THERE (8x)
3rd Stanza of Verses 
It's tightwork when you ballin' with a chicken head
Who a red dirty foot and she ain't even scared
Take her to the spread
Lay her on the bed
Wild out with her
And tightwork in her
It's tightwork, when dem boys on dat hemp
Then bust off in da club with a gangsta limp
If you a pimp and you got yo pockets swoll up
So many hundreds that it won't fold up
Now who want girlies tight to def
Bouncing dat there from right to left
Now off in the Cadillac
With AB and Daddy Black
Ski-Bo crank da track
So I can freak dat
It's tightwork when we freak dat
All that's the life dawg
Let a playa freak dat
