Black With N.V Lyrics
Now, I was told to never bite off more then I could chew
But then you better bite enough for if you don't, my boy, you're blue
Now I wonder, can others see the system my eyes see
Or do they see and say they don't and blame it on society
The days Iâ€™ve spent on Earth come to over just eight thousand
And as I live I learn because there's always someone mouthing
Speaking on an issue, praise you or they diss you
Long as I come strong the words fly by me like Scott tissue
My people: from 'nigga' to 'negro' to 'man of color'
Killed my father and my brother so that you could rape my mother
Now you wonder, why is it through instinct you fear
Wouldn't dare me to stare, run for self, you're out of here
Not to worry, to harm you, not intention of my creed
But to stop your greed and give me what I need
Opportunity, for a life for me
And generations to come within tranquility
Now harmony is a total love of things
For those who are inclined or better yet like to sing
But peace of mind, it is my right therefore the spark will ignite
'Till I can catch a cab at Midtown at midnight
'Till I can be myself and not be thought of as worse
'Till I can buy a slice from Howard Beach to the 'Hurst
'Till I can get to play without fear of eject
And occupations which I seek I can have if I select
Now if I so select and reach out to make touch
How can you say that I ask for too much?
Don't speak to me if good times are granted 'till I be
Don't tell me of the countries or the islands that you seek
Don't tell me to keep trying, you know I won't agree
Double negative means positively black with envy

As a player of the game, of the lifetime game I'm playing
I bet you nod, mm-hmm, and shake your head to what I'm saying
It's keeping me bent but those of men color of skin could even begin to wonder
What is it to ponder to let another bother
Listen, stay open not dismissive
Lack of vision makes division, product: no ambition
Wishes which you wish upon, you wish were more than wishes
If I wish not to work hard and study not, then I wash dishes
Wish while I wash, the water hot gets colder
Black I'm saying that in fact the dish gets clean and I get older
Seemingly so, the dishes will grow to dishes well beyond me
Lost my wish and broke a dish so now I'm wishy-washy
Understand foundation, create my own creation
If dumb and pumping jumb I then get no ovation
But only restriction, bullpen means lots of friction
I then wash a dish without pay? Boom! N.W.A
Think I'm lying? Black, I'm crying salt, a tear would turn to crystal
Crystals forming on my dishes so I wash until dismissal
Wash until my prints are wrinkled, then they let me go
I know not where I'm going so I know not where I go
My people give me money but the money much too low
For me to meet the match of present day so I still need more dough
Conjure up a suit, I wish that it were cute
Borrow a token and a smoking I begin a wish less hope
Interview and application leads me on into frustration
And duration of my time is spent in lack of occupation
Time to go for what I know, I know not of a wish
But of soap and a towel and some water and a dish
You might also like
Don't speak to me if good times are granted 'till I be
Don't tell me of the countries or the islands that you seek
Don't tell me to keep trying, you know I won't agree
Double negative means positively black with envy

But lay okay cause you can get the play
I peep your style, your smile shine bright about a mile away
But anyway, another day, in the land of shove
Just living in the life of who:
A black man on a green land with a blue skyline
Don't tell me I'm color blind
I'm seeing system, it's hard to believe in
Underneath the underside of underachieving
Bust my ass in school, to be a certified fool
Now intellect of curb is my only tool
But street game is so uncouth
I took the SATs and that's the sad-ass truth
I'm not gliding but I'm striving
Hanging on by a thread and it's called surviving
Hang on, hang on, hang on, y'all
Walk the street and keep your head so tall
For time is short, no time is bought
You're only in the wrong if you get caught
So kick in doors, bang on walls, shout in halls
But get yours, y'all, get yours, get yours, y'all, get yours
Get yours, y'all, get yours, get yours, y'all, get yours
Don't speak to me if good times are granted 'till I be
Don't tell me of the countries or the islands that you seek
Don't tell me to keep trying, you know I won't agree
Double negative means positively black with envy2Embed
