Boom Shak-A-Tack (Dancehall Remix) Lyrics
Warning warning warning, to all those who have been yawning
Kids from foreign, coming down in the early morning
This is the darn gone one they call Edley
Mr. Notch who the girls them watch, on the side of me
On the remix tip

The wickedest time, me and me girl a come
Born Jamericans, tear the place strong
Now put it down yeah, Papa make it tan de yeah
Sometimes coffee, sometimes tea
You know they say Born Jamericans are celebrities
We ran dance tunes, and in the country, whoa
Look at the girls them nice and sweet
Me want it every day, yeah
Not to mention the week
They say reggae music's round the world
Me respect that
'Cuz every time we touch the mic
Them screaming boom shak-a-tack
All the massives catch the vibes
We're unorthodox
This is a lesson, definition, of the boom shak-a-tack
No batty rider, tear off a girl picnic, get hot
But ya boy beat down wall
Selector wheel up that
The Shine give you the verbs
Which is the action words
Dropped them in my rough neck style
That make the song boys observe
And I would never run away in the heart of battle
I round up the girls, them, like cowboys round up cattle
From line one, verse two
Me just show off my skill
And I would never sell my soul for a thousand dollar bill
Reggae music round the world, me respect that
'Cuz every time we touch the mic, they screaming boom shak-a-tack
All the massives catch the vibes
We're unorthodox
This is a lesson, definition, of the boom shak-a-tack

The wickedest time, me and me girl a come
Born Jamericans, tear the place strong
Now put it down yeah, Papa make it tan de yeah
Look at the girls them nice and sweet
Me want it every day, yeah
Not to mention the week

Physical fit is the kid
When me start to release
Me grab the microphone and chant
To make the dollars increase
Sexy girls to the front
Come hear the healthy young man
And me will surely give you the remedy
One by one
Born Jamericans is the crew
From the streets of Washington
Where nuff people smoke the crack
And them fire the M1
Me legalize me not despise
The air is rugged and rough
Some DJs open up their mouth
It's like a damn trash truck
But reggae music's round the world
'Cuz every time we touch the mic, they screaming boom shak-a-tack
All the massives catch the vibes
We're unorthodox
This is a lesson, definition, of the boom shak-a-tack
