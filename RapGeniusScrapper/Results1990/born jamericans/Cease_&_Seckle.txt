Cease & Seckle Lyrics
Now this is the Cease and Seckle
So turn down the kettle
'Cause dancehall get hot
And the kids them want them props
For the season
Hear the reason!

Here we are
No one can steal this moment
'Cuz we're just where we belong
The vibe just keeps on flowing
It goes on and on
I see the young girls dancing
The rude boys want romancing
Making simple passes
It's a pleasure to see
People in harmony
For the ones who rule
Born Jamericans rule, yeah
Them try fi dis Yankee, artical that
If you really check it out you need a battalion
How the hell can them stop this ya combination?
It's like you get a swift kick when you a penny the right hand
I want fi see the young girl just fling up your hand
Cock out your backside, and start whine pon your man
Some gyal a try fi Butterfly, but them look quite absurd
It's not the "Butterfly", but better yet the "dead bird"
Inclination of the Shine, is the matter at hand
Fi perpetuate mi self as a don gorgon
I make spin pon your toe with the rub-a-dub flow
Original style when you come to the show
Self proclaim is the kids from foreign
Pioneer, with the length and strength to cause havoc
Jumping outta di pot
With me lyrics pon cock
Edley Shine fi a minute, then comes Mr. Notch

Where we've been and where we're going, keeps them hoping we'll die
Yet, the magic we project keeps dancehall music alive
Fill the air with vibes of happiness
And strength to those who feel the rest
From a land not far away
See and hope for much better days
You might also like
And it's a pleasure to see
People in harmony
For the ones who rule
Born Jamericans rule, yeah

This a doggart youth, shall always survive
Proper live the youth, all of them goin' die
'Cuz them never give the Ed or the Notch a one bligh
Mi have to sit down inn corner, and ask myself, "why?"
Never think we coulda rip up the market
Boom Shak-a-tack, that  put we pon target
Now them have to cease, while the crew just a seckle
Boiling point, like the water inna kettle
Every label 'round the world wants the kids them to sign
Bring sound to the deaf, and sight to the blind
Now you all get the finger, plus a batty jaw fi kiss
Nah take back no chat, nor change mi language

Unuh fi just, cease and seckle
Turn down the kettle
Dancehall get hot
And now the kids them want them props
Me say, cease and seckle
Turn down the kettle
Born Jamericans pon on the map
And now a easy, non-stop
Hear me now!
Here we are
No one can steal this moment
'Cuz we're just where we belong
The vibe just keeps on flowing
It goes on and on
I see the young girls dancing
The rude boys want romancing
Making simple passes
It's a pleasure to see
People in harmony
For the ones who rule
Born Jamericans rule, yeah

It's instant death!
Kids pon the mic, without powder, no pet!
When them see we inna dance, you know them start fret!
Get a rally back, and try figure out yet
All of the crew but still have fi dress
Back pon the top, cuz how the hell them gonna manage
When the kids from foreign is out to do damage?
Rape and pillage
While you get rubbish
On the microphone, so

Unuh fi just, cease and seckle
Turn down the kettle
Dancehall get hot
And the kids them want them props
Me say, cease and seckle
Turn down the kettle
Born Jamericans pon on the map
And now a easy, non-stop

Outta far and out so near
Born Jamericans are finally here
Yes we gonna run dancehall music
For years...
Thats why I say!
