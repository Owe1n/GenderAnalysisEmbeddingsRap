Superstar LyricsHey to every club we play
Eh eh
Every beach in the way
We gonna rock and no play
Eh eh
Everyday
We say, whoever you are
Nobody whine like you are superstar
No? whoever you be
Nobody whine like a celebrity
Whoa
We say, whoever you are
Nobody whine like you are superstar
Whoever you be
Nobody whine like a celebrity
You know these stars I know exist in the sky
And people trying to be like them
Don't coincide with reality
Just its a mere facility
Needed to be done way it was said to be
Cuz its been done and will only carry on
And alot of people coming up
Will make it prolong
And not realize that they
Got it all wrong
And its too late
And the thing is all wrong
So
We say, whoever you are
Nobody whine like you are superstar
No? whoever you be
Nobody whine like a celebrity
That one you say got my soul and in my garden
And will take it from the and im forgotten
If not the world
If you come back down to Earth you acting like a Jerk
Claim to me bigtime of a warlord all the time
So why dont you claim it run it down the line
Unused mind
You're going to far, press rewind
And you vote mr. i guess mr. mc maybe
Give up on the one
Thinking you'll switch
That why you so rich
You're dollar number one
You might also likeRecord deal
No fear
Real career
Feeling like a jerk
Everyday an obstacle saves me
We say, whoever you are
Nobody whine like you are superstar
No? whoever you be
Nobody whine like a celebrity
Whoa
We say, whoever you are
Nobody whine like you are superstar
Whoever you be
Nobody whine like you a celebrity
Don't you act like big shot make it bad for the rest
To be misjudged and put to the test
And make people dem lose a certain interest
And what it really means to be a reggae artist
Responsibilily and obligation to your fans
To sign an autograph, take a flip or shake a hand
And fuck the moment
When you are in popular demand
And be a role model as best as you can
So
We say, whoever you are
Nobody whine like you are superstar
No? whoever you be
Nobody whine like a celebrity
That's why you say DJ know where it is
Up close selection
Keep it in the north
And play it sensation
We can mash up things
And jump some flash
And when you check it out
And pack it up have no class
Keep it down
True microphone chemist
Through time and space
Passing through the outer limits
Absorb only to understand
Make sure you have the most diplomatic game plan
Just it keep it from me
Inside your own hand
Stay original and use your meditation
But if you want ice up your chest
And give you your most inner wanted
Just give your thumbs up
Be clear your mind up
Don't dope up
That one you say got my soul and in my garden
And will take it from the and im forgotten
If not the world
If you come back down to Earth you're acting like a Jerk
Claim to me bigtime of a warlord all the time
So why dont you claim it run it down the line
Unused mind
You're going to far, press rewind
More caviar doesn't make you a star
We say, whoever you are
Nobody whine like you are superstar
No? whoever you be
Nobody whine like a celebrity
Whoa
We say, whoever you are
Nobody whine like you are superstar
Whoever you be
Nobody whine like you a celebrityEmbed
