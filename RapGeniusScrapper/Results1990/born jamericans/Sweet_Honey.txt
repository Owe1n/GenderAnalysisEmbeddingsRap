Sweet Honey LyricsThis one is dedicated to all the girls around the world
Born Jamericans love you like diamonds and pearls
Hey young girl like Cheryl
Here it is! this one is ultra!
Days gone by (baby love)
And I wonder why
I'm in love with you (lovely love)
I know what she was trying to do
But no matter what the time of year
You'll always be there for me
Yeah-eh yeah
Because you are my sweet honey
Well hear me now
Sweet honey

Caress you your sexy body
Sweet honey
Because I tells you you're the cure for me
Rub my body nice eh nice
Because you're sweeter than the honey that comes from the tree
You are my art my soul, my whole all my life, intricate
Every man wish they had you from me

My boo you me key-ingston
Mr. Art Feelings you know from key-ingston
Sweet honey
Because you're the cure for me
Them type a girl ya your love I feel for eternity
Sing out
Time marches on
But I love a place that I know is strong
Looking at your lovely face
It is stopping even through time and space
But even if I had to walk through danger
And split up the seas

Some offer up the dollah some offer the jewelery
But them still champion
She is my sweet honey
And i walk up to my girl

Because only thing she need is affection
Even experts, only I can understand

You are very decent woman the one for me

I always want her beside me (want her beside me)
True love you can't deny me (you know you can't deny me)
I got these feelings inside me (feelings in side me)
Just take it easy
I don't think anything else will please me
Except my sweet honeyEmbed
