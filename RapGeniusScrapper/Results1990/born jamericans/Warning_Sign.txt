Warning Sign Lyrics
Warning Sign!
And return to the foundation
This is Edley Shine and a Notch
Kids from foreign live, click click
And now ya boom boom click
Watch this!

(vocalizes) 
A lotta man nuh get nuh (pum-pum) tonight, no
A lotta woman nuh get nuh (pum-pum) tonight-ight
Becuh ya see decision is getting harder
And ya know sir Born Jamericans will live long and prosper
Come on ay!

Jah mi seh red light, yellow light, green light, go!
Kids pon de mic, we are de star fi de show
Red light, yellow light, green light, go!
Ed pon di microphone so all the mass of y'all a blow
Mi seh easy pon the toker, Edley Shine is relaxed
Ya cyaan get de message, then we send it pon a fax
Watch pon de riddim, how me cool and relaxed
When ya see de red light, some boy give a stop
Rub-a-dub he tried to hurt on Edley Shine, nuh decieved
When you see de yellow light, some boy reduce your speed
Reggae music a de wata, so tell it to ya daughter
When she wine up in a dance, you might think she outta order
It's not the slackness, I man a defend
Now ya get de green light, so make de niceness begin
You might also likeCuz a red light, yellow light, green light, go!
Kids pon de mic, we are de star fi de show
Red light, yellow light, green light, go!
Ed pon di microphone so all the mass of y'all a blow

Ay!
I'm feeling 'orny, woah, ya best believe I want punani
Woah, you want di body from Johnny
Woah, only punani from Lonnie
Woah, it's like, how'd 'em gonna manage?
When de kids from foreign know how to do damage, woah, hey
How'd 'em gonna manage?
When de kids from foreign know how to do damage, woah, hey

Detrimental is the cause fi de crowd dem applause
Warning, warning, danger, danger, intrudah inna de law
Dancehall is protected by a light which is a red
Infrared is de texture pointin' straight to ya head
Ya better learn 'bout de foundation you neglect
Warning sign 'cause Ricky D and Josie will get respect
Bogle never run de wata 'scape, land start de trend
When ya play at Studio One, watch people wheel on back
Universal is the message of all which is true
We got the culture to the box because we're long overdue
As a rub-a-dub-a rebel, head back into time
Take a ho, cock stand up and start newly design
Lord mi prayers can all cheer for reggae music set speed
And start press pon de gas because the light done turn green
Mi seh red light, yellow light, green light, go!
Kids pon de mic, we are de star fi de show
Red light, yellow light, green light, go!
Ed pon di microphone so all the mass of y'all a blow

Ay!
Some girls look good, but dem but dem nuh ready, no
Some girls look good, but dem but dem nuh ready, no, hey

Warning sign is getting hotter, so tell me what's the matter?
Another form of block music servin' up from de platter
Foundation and revival so its time to rekindle
The days when dancehall was filled with lyrics that you can feel
Like the lyrics that make ya happy, the lyrics that make ya sad
The lyrics that make ya feel the lastin' love that ya had
Conscious lyrics to make ya pray to Almighty Jah
Mi born a foreign but mi love y'all still
Mi a go shout it out pon a mountain or a hill
Keep ya culture, keep ya soul and not just comin' from the Shine
Somethin' fi ya heart and a thought fi ya mind
Inclanation is dead, you betta heed de warning sign, eh eh
Jah mi seh red light, yellow light, green light, go!
Kids pon de mic, we are de star fi de show
Red light, yellow light, green light, go!
Ed pon di microphone so all the mass of y'all a blow

Warning, said it's a warning sign
Some boy ya dead before ya reach border line
Warning, said it's a warning sign
Some boy ya dead before ya reach border line
Red light, green light, go
Red light, green light, go
And me don't start
Red light, green light, go
Red light, green light, go
And me don't start, yeaEmbed
