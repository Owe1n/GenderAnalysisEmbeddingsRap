Slow Down Lyrics
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Hey, baby, your hips was getting big
Now you're getting thin, you don't care about your wig
Now Woolie Willie got a pair of my sneakers
Wonder where he got 'em, 'cause I hid 'em behind my speakers
The object of your affection is the treetop connection
Where basically you love to smoke your wools
The crackheads and crack men they come up to my door
I don't smoke jums, so what they knocking for?
Kids love to feel on you, feds got a seal on you, street time is limited to days
On your crack card you're getting only A's and C's for come back
Damn, it's a shame you're the mighty queen of vials
With a wide-eyed look and a rotten-tooth smile
Used to walk with a swagger, now you simply stagger
From one spot, on to the next spot, on
To the next spot on to the next
Bitch, get a job, from me you won't rob
'Cause I'll smack you with a hose filled with sand
Now give that to the crack man
You was fly once, now you're losing all your fronts
Started off light, only tipping woolie blunts
But now you get a a stripe, graduated to the pipe
Took a long pull, hype
Yeah, head crack, head crack
You smoked up that stack in a minute you was back
(Ayo, X, wasn't that your girl?) Yeah, I had to drop her
'Cause she caught on the plastic and I just couldn't stop her
Slow down
Slow— Slow down
S— S— Slow down (What I am is what I am)
Slow down (What I am is what I am)
Slow down

I knew this girl named Tropicana, she's always juicing
Producing cash from her sexual tasks
She loves men that trick like Halloween and treat
You ain't paid, then your grade is incomplete
You've got to flash dollars to prove her
And when you do she sucks it up like a Hoover
Taking all your papes like inhalation of vapes
Her nasal passage is filled with money, and it's massive
What I am is what I am
Well, what you are is a stunt, man, you're on a hunt
And your plan is to take all you can from a man and scram
I've seen your kind before, you're not original
Just a sick, mixed-up individual
Giving up the crotch for a fresh gold watch
Marking off the goods you get going up another notch
Your ways and actions are like those of a savage
If the price is right, then anyone can ravage
Even Monty Hall can have himself a ball if his assets are in order
What's really scary is you're somebody's daughter
So don't come around trying to make a profit
At the expense of another man, stop it
'Cause you see, you're the freak show of the town
Know what I think you ought to do is
You might also like
Slow down
Slow down
Slow d— Slow down
Slow down (What I am is what I am)
Slow down (What I am is what I am)
Slow— Slow down
Slow down

As the jewels jingle from the hot young and single little stunt
A forty and a blunt, that's all she really wants
But she'll spend your papes and she'll use up all your plastic
And if you swing an ep', you'd better wear a prophylactic
'Cause things are getting drastic
Slide up in the wrong one, you'll end up in a casket (Slow down)
Sister, there's no need in speeding
She was doing lays before she started bleedin'
What makes a bitch want to act in this fashion?
Pulled more stunts than my man Action Jackson
A real gold winner just like Bruce Jenner
Lay the bitch on the bed and then you run right in her
Puba makes no mistakes
She said, "Rock me tonight for old time's sakes"
Picture that (Slow down), you little hooker
Honey got a problem with the bends
Meaning she likes to bend over and then she spreads the skins
The ho is just a ho and that's without the controversy
She can make the bedsprings sing a song of mercy
Come on, toots, you can take a thousand douches
Scrub that ass and I'll still pass (Slow down)
You're living foul (Slow down, slow d— slow down)
Now see it ain't no reason for you to be out here skeezing
'Cause it's not the season
So if you want to live foul and be a dum-diddly-dum-dum bitch
Well, go ahead
Slow— Slow down (What I am is what I am), you're livin' foul
Slow down (What I am is what I am)
Slow— Slow down (What I am is what I am)

Now I'd like to give a special shout to my DJ Alamo on the help out
Now my light's out
Slow down
Slow— Slow down
Slow— Slow down
Slow— Slow down
Slow— Slow down
Slow— Sl— Slow down
