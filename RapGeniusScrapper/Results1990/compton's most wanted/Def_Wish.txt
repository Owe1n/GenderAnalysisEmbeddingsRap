Def Wish Lyrics
Geah
The MC Eihts in the mothafuckin' house, you know what I'm sayin'?
The Compton maniac here to break your ass something off real proper, you know what I'm sayin'?
Damn!

Suckas, I go for broke, so don't choke on the smoke
'Cause if I hit the chronic, Eiht starts to rap bionic
So enough with that punk shit
With your fucked up lyrics, you can't shoot the gift
Like ya should be shot
Gots no parts, punk ass marks, don't start, you'll get got
And at the end of the trail is what's left
Is a sucka mothafucka who done simped to death
So if ya got static, go and gather up your army
You'll be a short ass punk tryna harm me
I bet you sorry MC's never seen this
A sucka punk hung up by his penis
So watch out for a sucka on the gank
Cause while Compton's Lynchin, I'm taking money to the bank
And its the MC Eiht on your shit list
Commence to killing you off
You gots your Def Wish
I'll make you famous...
Now when I go for my gun, start shooting
And you are dead... (gun shots)

Phase 2, Its the brother who be taxin'
Runnin' over punks like my brother Bo Jackson
As your card's on freeze, frame your chicken
It's the Eiht, double M, and I'll keep stickin'
All that pay back shit is in effect
'Cause I'm the type a brother who will blast your ass, check
So if you're biting my lyrics, then fool, you'll pay
As you commence to say 'em, you'll get tooth decay
So give up to the Compton psycho
Biting me quick, will mean you get the duck sick quick
Not a funny man, but still, I gives surprises
Lyrics of deadly plagues, the death toll rises
So now you're shit outta luck with your rhyme scheme
And now, I'll hunt your punk ass in your bad dreams
Another victory on my list
One more punk ass fool with a Def Wish

(Gun shots)
Y'all done lost me a nigga, but at least I shot me a nigga
Right on time
I'll make you famous
Now when I go for my gun, start shooting
And I promise you, you will not make it
And you are dead (gun shots)
You might also like
Now say your prayers, because its difficult to get with this
I'll haunt your studio, become your ghost lyricist
No mistakes I make, so don't fake
Yous as sorry as fuck, so jump your ass out a cake
Don't try to bargain with the maniac maestro
On the stage, I'm in a rage with a gangsta show
The Capital E, The Capital I, the Capital H
The Capital T, down MC
Mike T is the partner down with me
Suckers got static, here goes the G-A-T
So take a step up, and play for the rhythm
From Compton boy, and this is what I give 'em
A blast from the gat, just for talking that junk
Feel like handlin' the business might smoke the punk
I run the nine one, fool, so get hip to my ways
And don't be no hero like in the western days
At sundown, you'll press your luck and try to shoot me
Grab your Davy Crockett, I got my gangsta uzi
And after all that, you'll still be R.I.P if you fuck with me
Fool, there's your Def Wish

Geah!
You know what I'm sayin'?
MC Eiht stepping to the mothafuckin' '91
My DJ Mike T's in the mothafuckin' house
Down with the DJ Bolo, and Unknown
Geah!
Right on time
I'll make you famous
And you are dead
(Gun shots)2Embed
