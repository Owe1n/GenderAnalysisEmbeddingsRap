Def Wish II Lyrics
So long Mel, have a good trip..
You die motherfucker! You die motherfucker!
.. {*Tony's sister screaming*} ..

"For most of the guys, killings got to be accepted..
Murder was the only way that everybody stayed in line..
You got out of line, you got whacked, everybody knew the rules"

Nigga get ready cause you can't hang
With the psycho motherfucker who slangin these gangsta thangs
Lock your doors, run and hide
Can't nothin save you when the W hoo-rides
Peep - I'm puttin suckers to sleep
Ready to make a motherfuckin hit, geah we rollin too deep
You shouldn'tve made that tape, but you pushed me
Eiht hates punk-ass perm wearin pussies
Mmmm... you ready for round one? Here it come fool
I got my dick in my hand, come and get some
Damn, I'm tired of fake motherfuckers gettin pesos
Sorry-ass amigos screamin like bitch hoes
If it wasn't for your happy-ass sound, prancin around
Nothin but a sorry-ass clown, stay the fuck down!
Punk you can't fuck with this
Geah, first step is your Def Wish
.. mmm .. geah ..
.. c'mon y'all ..
I guess it's time to get to the good part
Geah you know it's the part when the Eiht start
With the routine, it's the same song
Peel another cap - now what's goin on? Geah
Tickety toc you don't stop
Fool, you hear a click I bust your chops
Right, no future, in your frontin
Smoke your ass like a mother-fuckin blunt
Damn I hate ya punk
Cause you'll never equal, this motherfuckin sequel
Tell me can you fade that black
Or get slung like a fuckin 50-pack
So it's the second call they're all sorry
Punk motherfuckers that's out like Atari
Geah nigga you can get the fist
One more Def Wish

"But sometimes, even the people who DIDN'T get out of line
They got whacked.. hits just became a hazard for some of the guys..
Shooting people was a normal thing, no big deal.."
Last verse .. don't curse
Nigga fuck that, Mike's got the gat
And I'm ready to bust a head or two or three
Bitch come deal with E - geah
So gang way, as I pump another sucker
And I'm swift as they scared stiff by a psycho motherfucker
I see their pain, fool take two
To the fuckin jaw, geah fuck you
A nigga from the city where shit
Just don't motherfuckin quit
And jackin's my specialty G
Quik fast to mack once and take your money, geah
And down for the motherfuckin crew
Just like a bitch I gots to get paid to
I knock you out and when your punk-ass come to
You'll realize it was a nightmare of Def Wish.. II
You might also like.. geah .. geah! ..

"Hits just became a hazard for some of the guys..
Shooting people was a normal thing, no big deal.."
.. Whattup? ..

"Murder was the only way that everybody stayed in line..
You got out of line, you got whacked, everybody knew the rules"Embed
