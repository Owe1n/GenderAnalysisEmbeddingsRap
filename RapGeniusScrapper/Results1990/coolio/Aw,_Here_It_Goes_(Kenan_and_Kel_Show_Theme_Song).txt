Aw, Here It Goes (Kenan and Kel Show Theme Song) Lyrics
Aww, here it goes

Everybody out there, go run and tell
Your homeboys and homegirls it's time for Kenan and Kel
To keep you laughing in the afternoon
So don't touch that dial or leave the room
'Cause they're always into something
Or fronting and you don't wanna miss it
It's double K like, two to get greatness
Kenan and Kel, or should I say Kel and Kenan
And you gotta watch Kenan
'Cause Kenan be scheming
With a plan or a plot
To make it to the top
But they're kinda in the middle
'Cause they're always gettin' caught
This ain't the Hardy Boys or a Nancy Drew mystery
It's just Kenan and Kel in your vicinity
Like Siegfried and Roy, or Abbott and Costello
Magic and Kareem, or Penn and Teller
Somebody's in trouble? Aww, here it goes
On Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, Ni, Nick, Nick, NickYou might also like12Embed
