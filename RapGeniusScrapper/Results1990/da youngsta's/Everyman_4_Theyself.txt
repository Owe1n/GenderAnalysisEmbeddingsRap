Everyman 4 Theyself Lyrics x2
Selling drugs on a dime
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry nines
You all alone in these streets cousin
Every man for theyself in this land we be gunnin'

The black street walker
The ghetto can't get any darker
It's like an eclipse, call me the night-stalker
Breakin' in cars, creep in the mist up the streets
I pack heat to avoid being six feet
The W.B. clique up on the 4th street strip
Havin' deuce clips standin' with guns on our hips
And no patience led me to my incarceration
Living like a thug, underground like a bug
Police at my door, they wanna take me in
But then I saw the final frontier like Ren
I will never go down, I stand tall like a glacier
You trying to run but the bullet's behind racing ya
Being soft ain't my status, you'll ask who's the baddest
My crew is known for startin' madness
Don't sleep 'cause I'm known to grim reap
The lead and heat, you can't defeat
Have you shredded like wheats cuz...

Selling drugs on a dime
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry nines
You all alone in these streets cousin
Every man for theyself in this land we be gunnin'

No time to waste we on this loot chase
Me, Qu'ran and Taj with stacks of G's up in this suitcase
Moment of pleasure, ya whatever
I gots to have it, my mentality is now or never
Straight up, the city of brotherly hate
NY villains to help elevate the crime rate
With infrareds, TEC with a banana clip
I'm bout to flip, I'm on this Tony Montana shit
To his cream I felt greed my voice became knees
Fast life ain't guaranteed but health feed my seed
Sippin' on Asti, rockin' Versace
Feds wanna watch me but don't see what I see
The game of life is an everyday struggle
So I hustle and make moves by the muscle
As this wicked world revolves
Life to me still remains an unsolved mystery when I was...

Selling drugs on a dime
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry nines
You all alone in these streets cousin
Every man for theyself in this land we be gunnin'
You might also like
I packed a tre deuce sippin' on gin and juice
A badass hoe, lampin' in a Lexus coupe
Get a beep from my mean, call him on my cell phone
He said he just shot a nigga five times in this throat
Took ten grand in cash enough to buy a couple bricks
It's on son, let's get this money quick
But yo, we gotta watch our back
From cops and jealous punks, who might plan the attack
It's every man for himself, survive the game
The coke game ain't too much different from the rap game
It's all the same but I'ma stay on top
With three TEC-9s, two 45s and my verbal Glock
When it comes to cream I gotta get mine
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
It's fine, I'm genuine, a real hustler to the day I die
That's why I chill with peeps that be...
