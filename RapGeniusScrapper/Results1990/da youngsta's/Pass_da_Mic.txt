Pass da Mic Lyrics
I strike back with the mic and track
When it comes to drums it's like I hyper-react
My mind starts to generate words that penetrate
Then I eliminate suckers who imitate
Once again, I reveal the skill
Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal
It doesn't matter; hardcore or commercial
I'm universal, this says rehearsal
The name's Qur'an, consider me a brighter man
I'm climbin' charts like Spider-Man
A legend in my own time, with the microphone I'm
One of the world's most electrifyin' hosts
I dust MC's off like an antique
So, sit back and let this young man speak
Sorry suckers, take a hike
But for now, I'mma pass the mic
Pass the mic, yo, pass the mic!
Yo, Tarik, why don't you grab the mic?

I come to riggidy riggidy rip the rhyme, again and again and again
I go for what I know, more ready then I ever been
My rhymes luck against you all because it gets wicked
Never comin' off soft, so we could kick it
I'm slicker, quicker with the vocals
My pocket stay thicker than bifocals
So, here's a telescope if you can't tell it's dope
You put your hand in my spot? Nah, I'm here to tell you nope
Comin' with more hits than The Red Sox
No, I don't smoke blacks or dreadlocks
So, take notes to every move I'm makin'
'Cause Rick Gz'll definitely get your booty shakin'
Rippin' 'em up, throwin' 'em down
Groomed pound for pound with a hardcore sound
Right about now, I'm doin' just what I like
My time's up, so I'mma pass the mic

Pass the mic, yo, pass the mic!
You might also likeYo, Taji, why don't you grab the mic

I'm known to riggity rip, rip a rhyme like Jack the Ripper
Slick, ???
I got more juice than citrus, suckas can't get with this
I ring more bells than a Jehovah Witness
Somebody said I went out like a grape
I wouldn't hurt you physically, I hurt you on tape
Sit back, relax and just chill
'Cause I'm about to give you the definition of a real deal
The name's Taji, destiny's my crown
For everyone who's standin', it's time to get on down
Then you wonder how the heck I'm on stage
Rippin' up the scene just like the 12 gauge
Then let me flip, then rip and turn the page
'Cause I get dissed, very good for my age
Right now, I'm about to take flight
So, I'm gonna pass the mic

Pass the mic, yo, pass the mic!
Mentally Gifted, why don't you grab the mic?

Here's a quick flashback by me on the last track
Get a whiff of this, you won't want none of your cash back
Continuous flavor, I always seem to set you straight
You heard so many wack songs, I couldn't let you wait
Another minute, better yet another second
'Cause once I give 'em 1-2 check it, you know the brother's wreckin'
So, put me in the books, one of the best who did it
I'm the top soloist, all the rest should quit it
Ain't nothin' to it, I'mma do it like I'm hittin' skins
And at the same time, you can believe I'm gettin' ends
I catch fits 'cause it gets irritative when
Suckers act like they got a creative pen
But they don't, so they need to just settle down
Because it's time to put my foot on the pedal now
Some suckers thought I really couldn't do it right
But for now, I'm gonna pass the mic
Pass the mic, yo, pass the mic!
Mentally Gifted, why don't you grab the mic?2Embed
