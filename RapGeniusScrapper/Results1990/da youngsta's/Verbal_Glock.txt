Verbal Glock Lyrics
Yeah
WB, and Q-Ball
The foundator
The rhyme dweller, underground like a cellar
Uno mission wonderer, state of mind like a murderer
I'll pop crews with my verbal Glock for a living
I step with my sign buckshots is what im giving
I'm driven to my AK style state of mind
Giving all business sites bright lights to leave you blind
To the yes y'all Qur'an
WB in your area
Here to crush MC's and cause hysteria
I'll bury ya, with the verbal tech, lettin' loose
I'll make you stiffer than moose, I'm rugged like timb boots
Bring your troops I get rugged over loops
Ship you out like recruits and proceed like the roots
I wanna lamp in a AC with a MAC pulling hoes
For stacks of dudes forget pentos
Yo, my mind will always invent dope rhymes
Non-stop so you better drop when I come with my Verbal Glock
 x2
Listen up to the rhymes I drop
As I kick mad flavor from my Verbal Glock
You can't step to this, I got the Glock, cock
As I kick mad flavor from my Verbal Glock

Ease up nigga 'cause if you don't I'm gonna squeeze up
Girls gets skiis, flipping keys, I'm stacking G's up
It's that nigga TM, I'm driving Lexuses and BM's
And hoes be saying I'm trying to see him
Rugged and raw, great like Tony the Tiger
Universal like a pipe but short like a sniper
Check the ground beneath you
Nigga grim reap will keep you under
State of the plus I'm loud like thunder boom
I shake the earth as earthquakes
Never hang with snakes or fakes
It's all about getting weight
I got this whole globe to rear hear
Infared still appear
Taj Mahal is the man of the year
Champion, epitome number 1
The godfather's son so what's up dunn
Run and tell everybody that I'm coming
2 guns, hunnid, plus I'm wanted and I'm blunted and I'm out
You might also like x2
Listen up to the rhymes I drop
As I kick mad flavor from my Verbal Glock
You can't step to this, I got the Glock, cock
As I kick mad flavor from my Verbal Glock

Ayo who could it be?
It's Reek Geez
Fingers on the trigger and I just might squeeze
And start busting on shots with my Verbal Glock
If I was like a infared
Words by my pencil led
Armed and dangerous with every ammunition
Sniping competition, leaving suckers missing listen
You get wounded by the thoughts in my mind
Ripping through your teflon
With rhymes I design
Champion with my lyrical gun
They know they get done
They still on the run
Yo, must I spark this
Whole rap market brothers be like oh shhh
When I hit the target
Wanted by the law for keeping it raw
I murdered this track, peace yall im out the door
But before I go just to let you know
Youngsta's represent with that 95 flow
 x4
Listen up to the rhymes I drop
As I kick mad flavor from my Verbal Glock
You can't step to this, I got the Glock, cock
As I kick mad flavor from my Verbal GlockEmbed
