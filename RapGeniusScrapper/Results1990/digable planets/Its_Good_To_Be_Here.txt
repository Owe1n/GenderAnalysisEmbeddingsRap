It’s Good To Be Here Lyrics
Here they are

The ticky-ticky buzz, the sun wakes the sky
I fumble through my fuzz and buzz Mister I
Tell him scoop the beats in the flying saucer kit
Meet me at the port with the nickel bags and shit
Told my pops I'm out, earthbound with the crew
He said, "Butterfly, may the boogie be with you"
Left my moms a note with these quotes on the trunk
It says, "I split to Earth to resurrect the funk"
A dozen Snapple pops and a little box of eats
Travellin' through space with the funky, funky beats
Stopped at Pluto to cop some petrol
Met some Klingons and got our things on
Cruising Warp Six with Mister Wiggles in the mix
Hendrix passin' P, Star Child get the fix
The saucer shook the heavens with the blooms and the blams
Because when we hit New York, shazam
We droppin' like a comet and this Vulcan tried to Spock it
These Martians tried to do it, but knew they couldn't cop it
The others from our brother planet lands in the flesh
From up in Sector Six, yes, y'all
And it's good to be here when we landed up on Lex
Stirrin' up the ground with the sound of Doug E. Fresh
And the hard rocking kids that did it for the black
With the Pumas on their feet and the bombers on their back
We learned it and we earned it, so you know you got to hand it
We planned it when we left, how to freak it and to slam it
Add a Ladybug, transformation is complete
For the metamorphosis from the box to the Jeep
And it's good to be here, gettin' fly with the raps
We love it where we from, but we kick it where we at
Bumpin' out with somethin' that pops and transcends
DPs, baby, it's slim, but not thin
In amongst the pebbles, we rocks on your blocks
Soakin' in the ghetto for kids that have not
Slappin' on some skin, when we slam, check the cheers
So we greet their virgin ears with a kiss
It's so good to be here

We jazz up the streets to prove we have beats
Fat jazz, fat styles, and the sound so sweet
And there ain't no doubt that you got to check
Doodle, Silk, Butter, Mecc
It's so good to be here
You might also like
Yeah, baby, that's the style
The jazz can fill a club or papers by the pile
Just ask toy soldier, toy soldier could have told you
At the boomin' funk hut, it was the afro with the butt
So to the flam lovers that crowd in dark spots
To see 'em kick that lingo and grip that little crotch
Now we have arrived with crazy boogie sounds
Get yourself a mate, today's to boogie down
This is all we know, you feel it when we slams
You can hear the love, it comes out in our jams
The hip-hop digging cats just delivering the words
From the ghetto-dwelling youth, to the bourgies in the burbs

And it's good to be here, it's good to be here
It's good to be here, yeah, it's good to be here
It's good to be here, it's good to be here
It's good to be here, yeah, it's good

Good evening, insects
Humans too
The Cocoon Club is pleased to present to you tonight, a new band
Straight from Sector Six
And the colorful ghettos of outer space
They're some weird motherfuckers, but they do jazz it up
So let's bring 'em out here, yeah
Uh, thank you, thank you, word, cross
Ever since I was a caterpillar I dreamed of, you know, slamming up Earth, so we're gonna try to do it tonight
Let me introduce you to the insects, the players to you
On life, my main man, this cat is bad, check him out
C-Know, the Doodlebug, alright
On wide grooves, Silkworm
On vibes— What? What?
Yo, chill, man
I don't even know you, man, what you talking about?
Yo, bring it back, bring it back, right now
Yeah, as I was saying, on vibes, waves, and feelings, the Ladybug, Miss Mecc, yeah
Yeah, on P's and pleasing poetry
And on thoughts and tongue, and a little bit of actions, yours truly, Mister Butterfly
The mind is time, the mind is space
A horn rush, a bass flush, for minds to taste
So sit back, enjoy the set
Yeah
The mind is time, the mind is space
A horn rush, a bass flush, for minds to taste
The mind is time, the mind is space
A horn rush, a bass flush—4Embed
