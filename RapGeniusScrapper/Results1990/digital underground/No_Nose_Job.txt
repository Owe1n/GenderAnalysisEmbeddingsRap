No Nose Job Lyrics
Ruth, send in the next patient

Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job (Because I'm smarter than that)
Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job (Because I'm smarter, smarter than that)
Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job (I'm smarter than that)
Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job (Let's do this)
People say, yo Humpty now that your records is sellin'
Ain't it about time for you to be bailin' out
Of the community and race that you come from
Yo, your face has gotta change, son
Now that Cube says you're making more than Donald Trump
So yo, go on and get your nose fixed, Hump

Dr Cook: Sit down
Humpty: Wait a minute, uh-uh
Dr Cook: Get in the chair

Listen, now the black girl wants to get her lip tucked
She says Doc, I want my slim hips so I'm a slim figure
The white girl says my hips are not big enough
And yo, Doc, inject the collagen and make my lips bigger
All of these so-called celebrities are selling millions of records and claiming no responsibility
A young girl sees you on a TV show
She's only six, says "Mama, I don't like my nose!"
Now why'd you have to go and mess up the child's head
So you can get another gold waterbed?!
You fakehaircontactwearingliposuction carnival exhibit
Listen to my rhyme, you need to hear it
You might also like
Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job
Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job
I said dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job
Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job
(Uh, and you don't stop, check it)

I smell the message from the TV
Does my Humpty nose deceive me?
Smells like the blacker the wacker
Polly wants to be a cracker, if you let her
But see for me, the bigger the nose the better
They say the lighter the righter
Oh yeah?! Well, that's tough
Sometimes I feel I'm not black enough
I'm high yellow, my nose is brown to perfection
And if I was to change it'd be further in that direction
So catch me on the beach, I'll be getting a tan
Make sure there's no mistake that
Humpty-Hump is from the motherland
Laying in the sun, string bikini
Between the buns of two cuties
Still macking, there'll be no nose job
Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job
Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job
(There'll be no nose job)
Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job (No nose job)
Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job
(Uh, get stupid wit' it)
Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job
Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job (Kick it)
Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job (Get funky wit' it)
Dodio-doe, there'll be no nose job
Said dodio-doe, no nose job
