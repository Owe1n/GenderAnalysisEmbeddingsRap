Same Song Lyrics
Been all around the world
Been all around the world
Been all around the world

All around the world, same song
All— All around the world, same song (Been all around the world)
Yo, we've been all around the world (Been all around the world)
All around the world, same song (Been all around the world)
All— All around the world, same song
I came for the party, to get naughty, get my rocks on
Eat popcorn, watch you move your body
To the pop song that I'm singin', ding-a-lingin'
Funky beats ringin', everybody's swingin'
In the place as I kick the J-A-Z-Z-Y style
R&B mixin' it with a hip-hop swing beat
Champagne in my hand, it won't be long
'Til I'm gone, it's just the same old song

It's just a freestyle, meanwhile, we'll keep the beat kickin'
Sweat drippin', girlies in the limo eatin' chicken
Oops, don't get the grease on your pantyhose
I love ya Rover, move over, I gotta blow my nose
Sneezin', but still I'm pleasin' to all the slimmies
Pull out my Jimmy, time to get busy
With a Jenny if it's good and plenty, don't you know?
There I go, there I go, there I go
But I don't go nowhere without my Jim hat (Jim hat)
When I'm rappin' and if she's clappin', then I'm strappin' 'cause I'm smarter than that
And then, girlie, maybe we can get along
Cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song (Been all around the world)

All around the world same song
It's the same old song, y'all
All— All around the world same song
Uh, it's just the same old song (Been all around the world)
All around the world same song
It's the same song
All— All around the world same song (Been all around the world)
You might also like
Money B, the freaky-deaky, the squeaky-meaky up and down
Well as a matter of fact, I'll be right back, I gotta take a leaky
So while I'm drainin', entertainin', but I got fame
And the bases I touch, too much for me to try to be namin'
Ayo, you saw me on cable and grinned
I busted in and I was gone with the wind
Like Clark Gable, back in Oakland it's the same old song
For sporty Shorty, same freckles and hat, drinkin' the same forty

Hypothetical, political, lyrical, Miracle Whip
Just like butter, my rhymes are legit
'Cause I'm a Humpty, not Humpty Dumpty, but Humpty Hump
Here a Hump, there a Hump, everywhere a Humpty Hump (Aw)

Shut up and just listen, not dissin', don't get me wrong
But to me it's just the same old song
So just watch, 'cause my name is Shock, I like to rock
And you can't stop this, 2Pac, go 'head and rock this

Now I clown around when I hang around with the Underground
Girls who used to frown say "I'm down" when I come around
Gas me and when they pass me they used to diss me
Harass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me
Get some fame, people change, wanna live their life high
Same song, can't go wrong if I play the nice guy
Claimin' fame, must have changed now that we became strong
I remain still the same (Why, 2?) 'cause it's the same song
All around the world, same song
It's the same old song, y'all
All— All around the world, same song
Ya know, ya know, she'll catch ya, though
All around the world, same song
Ya don't stop, it's just the same old song
All— All around the world, same song
Hibby-dibby, ya don't quit
All around the world, same song
Aw, yeah, Humpty Hump in the house, y'all
All— All around the world, same song
And you know what? It's the same old song
All around the world, same song
All— All around the world, same song
Ahh
