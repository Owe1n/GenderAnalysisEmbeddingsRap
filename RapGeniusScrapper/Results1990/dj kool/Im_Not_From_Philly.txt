Alright, so this is a call and response record as they call it
So a lot of thisshit'll be real, real easy for y'all to do
So I say fuck it, let's take it to Philly
Since they with it like that
And let Philly represent
Is that alright?
I'm a say this hit here, I ain't from Philly
I'm from D.C
But I don't give a fuck about that
