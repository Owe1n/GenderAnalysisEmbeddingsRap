Let Me Clear My Throat (Old School Reunion Remix â€™96) Lyrics
One, two, three, come on!
We got DJ Kool and Doug E. Fresh
Rockin' to the beat 'cause we are the best
We got Doug E. Fresh and Biz Markie, (Hey!)
Rockin' to the beat in the place to be
We got Biz Markie and DJ Twenty
So hit me with your horns and make that money!

Let me see those hands in the air, y'all! (Yeah!)
Here we go now!
Hey!
Everybody jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump
Everybody jump, jump, jump, jump
Jump, jump, jump
Now Listen
Some of y'all know how to do this, and some of y'all don't
Some of y'all might get with this, and some of y'all won't
But listen, let me clear my throat (Uh, let's go y'all)
Oh (Say what?), have mercy babe, Ha!
I hope ya don't mind, let me clear my throat
Special dedication going out to everybody across the nation
And it goes a little something like this here
Aha, aha, ah (God Damn!)
Now all the way live from New York City
Mister Biz-mark, grab the mic and get busy

Can I kick it? (Yes, you can)
You know that I can do with the mic in my hand (Yeah)
Hahahaha, remember that
A' One-Two, yo that is fat
Zig-zag, zag-a-zig, zag-a-doo-doo-da
No matter what I say it always comes out fly
The ladies in here you're like fruit in a cup
I'm in love, I'm all shook up
You might also like
Yo, Doug E. Fresh my mellow, my man
Get on the mic and do the best you can
O-wee-o, yeah (Oho!) (Say what!)
O-wee-o (Say what) (Oho!), here we go!

Hep, hep!
Jammin' and crammin', the party people on the dance floor
They want to see why GFC, was called for
Shakin' and breakin', no mistakin' the identity
You know the man with the plan and the remedy
Showin' down, throwin' down, with rhythm
Sexism, magnetism and wisdom
So I flow like water, my faithful supporters
Grab the tapes, hit start to record a ...

Check the flavor of the rhythm I wrote! (Come on!)
While I got a chance here, let me clear my throat
Come on, y'all, let's go! (Oh!)
Have mercy, babe, I hope you don't mind, say what!
Let me clear my throat

Aha, aha, ah
Now y'all love us and we love y'all (Say what)
Represent yourself if you're havin' a ball
Puerto Rico! (Yeah!)
Black people! (Yeah!)
White people! (Yeah!)
All people! (Yeah!)
Puerto Rico! (Yeah!)
Black people! (Yeah!)
White people! (Yeah!)
All people! (Yeah!)

Now, put two fingers in the air! (Get 'em up)
Put two fingers in the air! (Get 'em up)
When I say "Tu", you say "Pac"
Tu (Pac!), Tu (Pac!)
When I say "Tu", you say "Pac"
Tu (Pac!), Tu (Pac!)
Tu (Pac!), Tu (Pac!)
Tu (Pac!), Tu (Pac!)

Hey-o, are y'all tired yet? (Hell, no!)
Are y'all ready to quit? (Hell, no!)
Are y'all tired yet? (Hell, no!)
Can I rock this hit? (Hell, yeah!)
Back to the rhythm of the funky jam (Say what)
DJ Kool is who I am, so
Rock and ya' don't stop
And yo, DJ Kool with that old hip hop
And a yes yes y'allin, havin' a party
I'm in the house and giving a calling
For you and your crew, thanks for coming thru and
DJ Kool, rock the old with the new and soul
Here we go, check the flow, now you know
That I'm that beast, to rock the whole damn show
To the beat, everybody
And if y'all come to party, hold it now
Hey-o, if the party is right where you are standing at right now
That's all good in here
Make some noise...
So check the flavor of the rhythm I wrote (Yeah)
While I got a chance here, let me clear my throat
Have mercy, baby, I hope you don't mind
Let me clear my throat
Get your hands in the air if you in here!
And yo  I love you
Now we need some help for the maestro, please!
Yes!
Haha!
Somebody make some noise in this joint, man!

Jam!

Come on now
Jam!
Go Doug E !Embed
