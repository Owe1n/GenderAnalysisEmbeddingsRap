Everybody Loves a Star Lyrics(chorus)
Everybody loves a star
1,2,3,4,5,Chill Will and Barry Bee make the crowd come alive
And check out the science I'm about to droop because....
I'm like a lion
From Mount Zion
Upon the hill move closer
Feels like a roller coaster
With a thrill just drooping
And never stopping
Until it reach every Hip Hopper
Or Bee Bopper in the streets
A man of mission
Tradition,plus
Fun and action
And Get Fresh
Won't rest
Until the job is done
Lights,camera,action
Now I've seem stars in all different forms
Some are ambitious and love to perform,alot
Some drive up and down the block
Like a big shot
And hey,Why not?
'Cause the girlies are with it
And look at you as a Czar in a car
A neighborhood super star
Romeo for thou
There you are
Just driving and ruling
Learning back,cooling
Growing and showin and knowin
Girlies be droolin
About you and
Not about to about face
Can't  leave your place
Got your whole neighborhood lost in space
You destroyed your community
Killed your unity
Smashed all dreams,hopes and opportunities
You know what?I'm not mad at you
You just doin' what you seen the next man do
Now every kid on the block
Is huggin on your jock
And you frontin like you a really real hard rock
Soft as a pebble
Working hard for the devil
But you and the devil are on a whole different level
You got a chance to grow
'Cause you know
That the man who made "All the way to heaven" and " The Show"
Is coming extra firm and full of determination
Collaboration of a new creation
Giving you,the insensitive of who you are and remember
You might also like(chorus)
Here's a real short story of a girl I knew
Who was very close friends of the Get Fresh Crew
She was livin' col' wrong
Hung out all night long
That's why I had to mention her in this song
She had a real nice shape
Got high as an escape
And just loved to hear a DEF hip-hop tape
Of the latest,greatest MC clones
And the name right now I'm gonna leave unknown
But she was too quick
Too slick and trick
But was a sure vick
For many men who was out to stick
And caress her body
Him and everybody young and dumb
And was a stone cold hotty
Workin' 9 to 5 right on the Ave
For what she have
And not need
Need and not have
And when I drive by
She always say " Hi"
And I'm not that fly
That I can't reply back
Even though
I know she's not up to par
Everybody loves a starEmbed
