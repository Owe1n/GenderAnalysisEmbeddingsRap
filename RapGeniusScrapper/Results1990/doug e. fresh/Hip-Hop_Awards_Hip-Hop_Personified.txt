Hip-Hop Awards: Hip-Hop Personified LyricsFirst of all I want to thank the creator who gave me the gift to do what I do, number 1.  Number 2, I've got to thank the original Get Fresh crew Chill Will, Barry B. in the audience. I also want to acknowledge Slick Rick always and forever. My brother Little Vicious, and I want to also thank Debra Lee, I wanna thank Stephen Hill, I wanna thank Jesse Collins for acknowledging me on this award and I want to thank the original Hip-Hop pioneers who established the game, and who I was blessed to learn from directly. I want to acknowledge my father he's in the audience and he's been with me since day one. And all my sons are here, I got 6 sons, all my sons. And last but not least I want to say this: I want to thank the woman 
I lost my mother 5 weeks ago. I want to acknowledge my mother because she was there since day one. Wow. My mother had Alzheimer's and before she passed away she was with me and she made a voice recording that I said, when this happened, that I'm gonna use this voice recording and I want you to hear what my mother said
:  Hi everyone my son Doug E. has something he wants to tell you
: And this is what I'm gonna to tell you: If it wasn't for Hip-Hop I don't know where I'd be
I thank god for the struggle
But dramas the best story, and glory
You'll receive the best glory
The negative vibes can't do nothing for me
I live for the love of my sons
Teach them how to walk righteous
Stay away from drugs and guns
Show them the man in me
Teachers strive to be as wise as me
And pray I'm alive to see
My seeds grow up
And rise to be the best they can be
Prominently, dominantly
The images of me in the form of 6 kids
Let them fulfill all their dreams
And avoid all schemes
From materialistic things
Teach them how to embrace queens
And put God above all things
You know why? You know why?
Because life ain't always what it seems
Keep your head up and never sell your soul for cream!
I appreciate you all!You might also like9Embed
