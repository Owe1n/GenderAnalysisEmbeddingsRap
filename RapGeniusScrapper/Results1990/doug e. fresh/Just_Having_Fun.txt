Just Having Fun LyricsUh, uh uh uh
Yeah!
Right about this time
Hey y'all watch this hear
Now bust it
For all the sounds ya beatboxers are doing
All you bit from me I should be suing
Some say yay but they should be booing
From the time you hear this rhyme your career is ruined
(beatbox noise)
You can't do that!
(beatbox noise)
This is the end!
(beatbox noise)
To enemies and to so called friends
The hater Doug Fresh is back for revenge
The hater Doug Fresh is back for revenge
The hater-the hater-the hater-the hater
Doug Fresh is back for revenge
C'mon
Uh-huh
You know what? Watch this here
My DJs are award winning
For their cuts without back-spinning
I am the human beatbox defender
Any other beatbox is just a contender
When he hear me, he will remember
Who, originated, created and made it
So he could bite it good, he played it and played it
But I'm superior, he's inferior
Every time he hear my name he get wearier
And Doug E Fresh echo in his mind
But the sounds I make is one of a kind
Like this!
(beatbox noise)
Uh!
Yeah ya know what bust this!
The cut mix maestro, cuts are nitro
Clip it, terrific, I'll be specific
The words I say show much significance
And for instance if you take the time to figure out this rhyme
You know it make sense
C'mon Will!
(scratching and cutting)
And ya know what
He's the cut professor, casual dresser
Body inspector, girl selector
Call him the creator or Barry Bee
And he's a wiz in trigonometry
You might also likeYou know what
The emcee hater, rhyme investigator
Known and respected as the female dater
Beatbox maker and plus originator
To a non-biter I'm the MC stranger
To a rhyme-biter I'm the MC ranger
To a rhyme-reciter I'm looked at as danger
And I could never be a perpetrator of a fraud
And you may applaud
And if you feel up to it, thank the Lord
For Doug E F-R-E-S-H

Human (Uh!) beatbox Doug Fresh (Break it down!)
The original, human, beatbox Doug Fresh
The original, human, beatbox Doug Fresh, (Say what! Bust this!)
The original
Analyze and handle, plus dismantle
And identify an MC scandal
Say one rhyme and you're left in a spell
'Cause I'm good at what I do and what I do I do well
It will take a while for another MC
To reach this type of technology
'Cause when I perform, I work up a storm
And why you'll getting hot I'm just getting warm
And common sense, I'm never tense
Sound like instruments, I'm magnificent
Midas uh!
Keep on and you can't resist
Chill Will, Barry Bee, can't forget about me
Together we're gonna do it like this, come on!
