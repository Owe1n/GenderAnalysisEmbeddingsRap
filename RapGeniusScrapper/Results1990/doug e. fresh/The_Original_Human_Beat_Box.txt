The Original Human Beat Box LyricsCrowd around everybody!
And everybody crowd around!
While I count if off
One...Two...Three
Party people check this out!
(beatboxing)
You know ya knew
I came to rock
When my legs start to shake
My head starts to rock
The mic almost stopped
But I catch it quick
And from that point we get hectic
Now, ask all the ladies
Ask all the boys
I am the one and only art of noise
With a (beatbox sound) and a (beatbox sound)
(beatbox sound) everywhere!
I'm the human beatbox known as Doug Fresh
And I go for more and not for less
Say my rhymes are good as gold in a treasure chest
And the way I rock people think I'm fresh
And if by now you haven't guessed
Other human beatbox soloists
Doug Fresh, the people can't resist
And they love it when I just go like this
(beatboxing)
I'ma tell you how it happened not long ago
Me and Chill Will had to do a show
Had to think of something different, something kinda new
Something that'll get attention, no one else can do
The control is mastered by only a few
With sounds from my mouth I can move your shoes
Hold up, don't leave I'm not yet through
Just check out what I'm about to do
C'mon!
(beatboxing)
Yo, break it down!
The beatbox is something I'll always perfect
I'll make ya ask is it live or is it Memorex?
Or is it Maxell? Or TDK?
Cause you'll never again here it quite this way
(beatboxing)
The schooler, the ruler, no one cooler
The brother, the lover don't believe me ask your mother
Say a fresh rhyme from now til next summer
While I get fresh, MCs will get dumber
Very outspoken and never caught smoking
Never hopped the train cause I keep me a token
Standing out like a light at night
Cause I'm like in search of fire, I do things right
I'm Doug Fresh y'all and I'm the best y'all
And I'm known to rock the rest
And you gotta keep on...
To the break of dawn
And everybody know my ? got to be ?
And young ladies, stay with me
And try not to telephone get me
And homeboy ya got static come and get me
And out of I hope she picked me
Now I'm the MC hater, no one greater
Number one and upon the crossfader
Add and subtract just like a calculator
Barry B known as the creator
? any MC that is a traitor
Biting my rhyme just like an alligator
Ya eat some now ya save some for later
It gets me hot just like a radiator
And I am deeper than your refrigerator
I'm gonna home and watch my beta
And mix!
And just relax
And chill will my girl and watch hot tracks
Cuz I actually ? sing acapello
Know with all the ladies as a real cool fellow
? ? ? girls ??
Skin tone too brown to be a high yellow
Voice range ? up to falsetto
Not too loud and not too mellow
To all the young ladies I'd like to say hello
To you, and without further ado
Just listen to the sound cause the words are true
C'mon!You might also likeEmbed
