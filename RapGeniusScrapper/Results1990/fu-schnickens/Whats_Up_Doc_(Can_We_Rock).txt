What’s Up Doc? (Can We Rock?) Lyrics
Can we rock
Yeah, what's up doc
Can we rock
Yeah, what's up doc
Can we rock
What's up doc
Can we rock
What's up doc

Cha cha cha, what's up pa yo who poop, your ma dooks
Or pa dooks, there's two scoops a raisin in the sun
Brothers try to rally up then dilly dally for some room
Bird peckin, double deckin, rubber neckin in my tomb
Check it out yo, I smile like Groucho Marx
I make a joke hokie poke and slide by like egg yolk
Play me like a punk like Penguin and the Joker
Snoopin in my biz like Tom and Roxie Roker
So bust a freaky freaky freaky ways
The brothers with the asianguise
Making g's and now we're sellin records overseas
Holy smokes, oops your whole plan goofed up
Now you get licks now get kicks nuff licks now kuffed up
Cuz you can catch a quick drop
For tryin to take the schnicks props
So tick tock around the clock
And shock while we lick shots (booom)
For goodness sake's the stakes are high
I'm out, abc ya' bye
Can we rock
Yeah, what's up doc
Can we rock
Yeah, what's up doc
Can we rock
What's up doc
Can we rock
What's up doc

I tawt I saw a putty cat, (what) I did I did
The humpty dumpty bashful grumpy quaker nabisco crisco kid
Cuz my styles figaro figaro figaro figaro like Pinocchio's
Big digital underground underground humpty dumpty camel hump
Nose so play dosey doe suffering succotash my mistletoe is gone
Snow white is after my seven dwarves my style and after me lucky
Charms, so leapin leprechauns be glad I'm pushin' my pedal
To the metal I'm rugged and rough for cocoa puffs yes and I love my fruity pebbles
So howdy my partner I starts ta get meaner
So ask Bob for Hope not Mr. Bob Dobalina
Oh where has my mic gone, tell me have you see her
I stretch like a condom, gets plump lika a weiner
Or a sausage of course it's time for chip to wreck it
But before my intro I gots to mic check it
So who is the nicest in your neighborhood
Lyrics are merry merry quite contrary
And captain crunch berry good so rah (rah) rah (rah) sis boom bah
Chip fu is coming again give thanks and praises to Jah
My lyrics are smooth like the head on Telly Savalas
My tongue starts to quicken like Speedy Gonzalez
Take up your pen your pad your lyrics and bag and run go whole a fresh
Touché pussy cat put down that mic cuz you can't rap
Cuz I'm dip dip divin, so so socializin
Clean out your ears, yes and open up your eyes-'n
I kick like Bruce Lee and I'm Jean-Claude Van Damme
So dunna, dunna, dunna, dunna, dunna, dunna, batman
I hip-hip, hop hop, don't don't stop stop
I'm harder than a flintstone comin' up bigger than a chub rock
Or types of lyrical styles yes the Chip stuck and kick 'em
I br-rr-rr-t stick 'em ha ha ha stick 'em

Can we rock

What's up doc

Rippin the program slow man hot damn
A grand slam swingin things again and again
Golly hachooey macho like rosoce
A randy sandwich manwich swing a ding-a-ling like damage
Pauish not antoinish nor monetego
Spanish like que? for the 9 2 lingo
Next a new hex commentators stand aside
Stringin mc's like a bikini or panty line
Nut you might bust but ya can't even come right
Spite the strokin or hopin or pullin a peace pipe
Huff and puff so what the fff is happening
On the lyrical miracle spiritual but everybody's rappin
Flip a new hit catch wreck to the 9 shit
Equipped never slip concept with a tongue twister
My styles that's buck wild no fake raps I push pounds
I flip mad scripts and hips I hit so bring the goya oh boy
As I say hasta manana tough and chewy hong kong fooey
Reggae the Rasta tough stuff can I rock
Can we rock
Yeah, what's up doc
Can we rock
Yeah, what's up doc
Can we rock
What's up doc
Can we rock
What's up doc

I'm the hooper (hooper!) hyper (hyper!) protected by Viper
When I'm out there hoopin' yo ya better decipher
In other words, you'd better make a funky decision
Cause I'm a be a Shaq knife and cut you with precision
Forget Tony Danza, I'm the boss
When it comes to money I'm like Dick DeVos
Now who's the first pick? Me. Word is born'in
Not a Christian Laettner not Alonzo Mourning
That's ok not being braggadocious
Supercalifragelisticshaq is alidocious
Peace I gotta go, I ain't no joke
Now I slam it, jam it and make sure it's broke
(repeat fade)
