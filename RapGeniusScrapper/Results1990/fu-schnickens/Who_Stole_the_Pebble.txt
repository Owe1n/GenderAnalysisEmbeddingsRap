Who Stole the Pebble Lyrics
I'll leave ya shook up with shit I cook up because I'm nice
I move like Jerry Rice on the mic device
Lyrics pour like rain with more soul than train
Incredible like the Hulk with Dr. Banner's brain
Making more noise than thunder
Making Stevie wonder how could one man get so ill with his rapping skill
That could stimulate ya mind and give ya brain a tumor
Kick a rhyme that's even fatter than the laces in my suede Pumas
The solo flexes on deck with a texture
Of movers so smooth like that nigga 
Burnin' up your chest like a bottle of Bacardi
Y'all niggas couldn't see me if you threw a search party
I'll mutilate ya head, I don't care whose side you on
I got more game, I'm swift like Hakeem Olajuwon
Stomping heavy on the scene, I'll strike like wolverine
Gettin' loose, kickin' crazy styles like Bruce, so tell me
Who stole the pebble out the master's hand
Tell me who stole the pebble out the master's hand
Tell me who stole the pebble out the master's hand
Tell me who stole the pebble out the master's hand

Hurray! Hip, hip! I'm ready to rip shit, I'm coming through
The wolf out the pack crispy black from the Fu
Watch out, I'm coming again without no hee doubts
'Cause I'm a blabbermouth, a blabbermouth
And I'm abouts to make stew with ya whole crew
Asta mada, asta mada, hey! Asta mada with you
I'm coming to steal ya ravioli and ya pasta pazoola too
Now I'm off, hee, freakin' the, hee, style, the wild rhymer *kisses*
So kiss my grits like, flee, flow from Mel's Diner
Time to freak it deadly hehehe follow me hehe
Check what I Scooby-Dooby-Doo when I'm shaggy hehe aha aha Buggin' with mind just like the Joker
But I'm comin' around the mountain
Fuck around, I'll surely smoke ya
Hope ya know that I follow the best of the munks (who?)
Buckets filled with water and I'm kicking tree trunks (who?)
I'm punching brick walls, doing all type of stunts (who?)
Was studying my styles, kid, for umpteen months
Once we hehehe came our niggas didn't have a clue aha
On how to pronounce the name and the concept kid of the Fu
Now everybody hehehehe wants to do what I do and I do what I do with the Fu
Now who hoo-hoo-hoo wants to battle aha that'll make me top ya
No rock ya, you can ask my aunt Betty or my uncle Frankie Crocker
Rocks my dreds just like ziggy, dig me, this one's a biggy
With lyrics closely knitted like Lenny and Squiggy
And I flex-kiz me muscles with no hustles or no hassles
I'm remarkable like the kids on Little Rascals
Don't give me no sticks, gimme no stones
Yo I'll be throwin' the fruity pebbles
And some big flint bones so back it up, I never heard of ya
Step then I'll murder ya, burning ya
Try to lift my style, you'll catch a hernia
I'm earnin' my status, yo I'm the baddest in the west
So don't test unless you want a hole in your chest so...

Who stole the pebble out the master's hand
Tell me who stole the pebble out the master's hand
Tell me who stole the pebble out the master's hand
Tell me who stole the pebble out the master's hand

I've been branded with the F.U. on my chest
I'm the best unless you follow in my foot steps
We're conceptual
I bet you all fall with tears like the beers on the wall so cheers
Congratulations, here's a toast to most of my peeps and my peers
From the bush it looks like Brooklyn's on the map
Old album went gold, now it's time to go platinum, umm...
I mean more than that
Plus we bust raps like a loaded gat or a pistol
Now this will reign number one, our tunes rise like the Moon
Kid and shine like the Sun, so run go tell a friend
'Cause it's the end plus the arrival
Don't you know that kid, it's the survival of the fittest
And I kick this straight from the heart and from the start
Let you know I'm rippin' shit apart, so...

Who stole the pebble out the master's hand
Tell me who stole the pebble out the master's hand
Tell me who stole the pebble out the master's hand
Tell me who stole the pebble out the master's handEmbed
