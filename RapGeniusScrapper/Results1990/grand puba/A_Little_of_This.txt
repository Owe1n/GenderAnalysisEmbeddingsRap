A Little of This Lyrics
Let's do it Yeah yeah
Get down situation get down no doubt 95. We're talkin' 2000
How we represent

Come a kick it with
A little of this and a little of that
A little of this
A little of this and a little of that
And a little of that
A little of this and a little of that
And a little of this
A little of this and a little of that
And a little of that
Check it
I get the gumtions to make your conjunction function
So honey get it straight or be on your roller blades and skate
My style switch fast like a rash then it get you itchin'
My flow is crisp like a bucket full of Colonel's chicken
I mould the beat like pottery lyrics flow like blood through the artery
With more rhymes then numbers at the lottery
You know my steelo have my dough and watch me drop a flow
I wax shit up and make it shine like I was Mop & Glow
So come on baby love let's put it on no fakin' moves
Let's flip on it heads I win and tails you lose - got ya
Grand Puba comes with all of that
Because I got more game then quarters in the laundromat
Uh we keep it tight, the way it's supposed to be
While jealous snakes say damn mon you should of swallowed me
No doubt cause we hit 'em with

A little of this and a little of that
A little of this
A little of this and a little of that
And a little of that
A little of this and a little of that
A little of this now a little of that
You might also like
Dig it
I got to be one of the baddest brothers on the planet
I'm baggin' honies and they all got bodies just like Janet
I play it safe never takin' chickenheads for granted
I'm Superman and Lois types my rhymes to the Daily Planet
I got more promise than Thomas who makes English Muffins
I do more stickin' in chicken than Stove Top Stuffing
No doubt about it hun I hit from here to China
When I drop the D minor watch me soggy your vagina
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie droppin' clonkite
Prefer the chocolate like the outside of a Klondike
That's how it go and that's the way it's designed
So you can stroke me down I don't mind
We keep it tight and that's the way it's suppose to be
While jealous snakes say damn mon you should of swallowed me

Cause we hit em with
A little of this and a little of that
Just a little bit
A little of this and a little of that
It gotta be that shit
A little of this and a little of that
Its just a little bit
A little of this and a little of that
It gotta be that shit
Take your time young man
The way it's designed to ease your mind in the 95 flavor. No doubt no questions asked cause we fulfill that task
Don't you watch the ghetto
We keep it real like Jill you know what I'm saying? We gonna
Move it on for the year 2000
Keep it in your stride
Big up all you New York City style squads in it to the fullest you know what I'm saying
Live your life, live your life
Live your life, live your life
Live your life, live your life
No doubt that's what we talking about
Come on and just get down with Grand Puba and Stud Doogie-Do
Get down with Grand Puba and Stud Doogie-Do
Get down with Grand Puba and Stud Doogie-Do
Get down with Grand Puba and Stud Doogie-Do
Big Jeff in the house The Neyru in the house and the K to the I to the D is in the house
2000, 2000Embed
