All Glocks Down Lyrics
I can break it down like whatever you want
I can break it down like whatever you want

All Glocks down, arriving is the bulletproof lyricist
All rude boy, big up, now hear this
I'm classic like a Coca-Cola, why don't you roll a L
And make it spiffy?
Are the L's twisty? Oh yes, let's get lifty
Long live the rugged female Heather B
So all you gun waving niggas put down your Glocks, please
No need for playing the hard anymore
The bulletproof lyricist is knocking at your door
So open up, let me in, let's get nasty if you wanna
I'll freak dat butt like a film by Heather Hunter
Touch you, cut you, I might just buss you
Buss your shit MC turned pretty
East coast, kid, how I swing
Bounce to Brooklyn
No need to tell you what I partook in
Just know Heather B. is back in town
It's no question, all Glocks down
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want

Walking with middle finger up, brown Timbs steppin' through
Coming soon to a corner spot near you
It's the sidewalkin' rap talkin'
Hip-hop sister, no need to try me, mister
You got rhymes, go for it, we need no chorus
Freestyles comin' from the door
And who's testin' the untestable? Style's flexible
You gonna have to bounce, twelve rounds
TKO by the third, fuck what you heard
I didn't feel like playing around
'Cause you's part-time with a part rhyme
Committing no crimes and claiming to be hard on the block
So feel my funk, my beat, my vibe
Recognize that I'm live, all live, you know the time
Kid, just raise up, rise up, open your eyes up
Already got you sized up, so wise up, bitch
A L to the neck, a double deuce of Becks
And now my mind's set, I'll be rowdy to the death
Do us part, one love rock crew, right here in heart
Don't even play me, son, you'll get did, done
Turnin' all gats or guns
I'll leave your shorty with her hair undone
And then you know Heather B. is back in town
So no question, all Glocks down
You might also like
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want

I got my peeps to my left side and then my right
Can't wait until tonight when real niggas turn trife
I love the orange light from the Dutch Master tip
My whole crew bent, a half a hunnid gone, spent
Chocolate Thai, true dat, yo, who him?
Who dat snatchin' up da L like a sniper?
Son, you will surely miss the next cipher
If you ever try to hog up the L again
Last one to put in, first son to dig in
Now I hear you riffin' me while I'm countin' your tokes
The Hen-loc burns my throat with no chaser
I'm feelin vibes by my hip from the black pager
Blowin' up for the nine-four or the nine-five
For da nine square, either way, say word-word
Heather B. is in there to the most high
And to the most def no quest', all Glocks down
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want

Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want
Glocks down, hit 'em with that funky sound
I can break it down like whatever you want2Embed
