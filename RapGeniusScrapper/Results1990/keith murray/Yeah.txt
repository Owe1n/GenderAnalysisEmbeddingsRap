Yeah Lyrics
Yo Troy, turn me up so I can conduct the disco inferno
Oklahoma aroma (uh)
I smell the roof on fire without Parliament
Just Def Squad shit, dig it
Rhymes I bust be like liquid swords
You abandon ship, real niggas stay aboard (word)
I'm flexin' hittin' you in the mid-section
Drop for protection. Cuttin' you clean like a "C" section
I puts it down in my field. I sport a vest
No need for a Brooke Shield kneel
E, an African boy with charisma
A lyrical giant bigger than Lane Bryant
Su-per rhymes be twilight zone warp speed true indeed
Don't forget boy I'm still hittin' swithes
In my Lexus truck, flaggin' down ugly bitches (word up)
Yo, yo, Erick Sermon y'all (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Def Squad y'all (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Flipmode Squad for yo mind, y'all (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yo, excitement, my lights be shinin' on niggas
Hit with more enlightment (yo), the major difference is
In many different instances, you could not go the distances
From drinkin' too much Guinesses, now look at all the witnesses (huh)
I told you one thing for sure, when I gets down son
I keep it pure, break the law from here to Arkansas (Focus)
I be the mostest, the dopest
Rhyme flow bounce atrocious
Bag of weed, my nigga, smoke this
Shit, I be stacking in jams, while I be packin' in
What's happen is I'm charged with interstate rhyming trafficking
Rhyme calisthenics will make you the the medic
Shit will break you down in order for me to see like the alphabetics
Yo, yo just go where practice
The fact is you do not listen, you go get slapped up with a cactus
Ass backwards, fart on mothafuckas just like BDP
I'm fresh for '96 you suckas
Keith Murray now

Yeah, yeah, yeah (Word up)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Busta Rhymes
Yeah, yeah, Yeah, yeah
You might also like
Now if you know the words then you can surely rap along
Go against the grain and surely get stomped strong
My squad is too high to get over, L.O's too low to go under
I'll rain on your brain and give you visions of thunder
See everybody loves Keith Murray 'cause I'm on the top
But i know ain't nobody fuckin' with me if I ever drop
It's all about the bread, spread, taught to me by E and Red
Fuck them niggas talkin' out the side of their head
Different day same shit. I heard a dope beat
But if E didn't do it, then you know I can't fuck with it
Here's something you all can understand
Fuck you coming from the fuck you man
Livin' in drama comma, trauma bubbling like lava
On site bomber to all wack rhymers
And if you ain't tough don't wear my logo
And if you ain't fly you can't play with my yo-yo
Cause whose pockets is fattest matters
I'll serve famous Keith Murray's beef curries
Scattered rappers on platters
For tryin' get at us, knowing we the baddest
With major operation, mental observation status, see
I used to love her then I got some Common Sense
Now it ain't funny, the bitch better have my money (word up)

Lace the chronic with the bomb-ba, hash in the tye
Blaze 'em up one time for my partner in crime
Ruger eye on my hip (why) cause niggas trip
Pull a burner, all you know is a murder occurred, a curb server
Wannabe swerver slash baller, got dome call
Hauled to the mortician for silly ambitions
I'm nice and precise, hard like rock
You shook like dice and pop like Glock
All my shit knock the shelves (yo), yo (yo)
Witness this nigga ro, trigga flow, digga ho
Niggas ass out, passout, excessively
Fuckin' with this manic-depressive will be the lesson of life
Spoiled rotten and plottin' and double shottin'
Packin', always rapping but smacking a lot of action
I am the in-house felon like Contra-Band
In demand, your mic in hand, seriously as a man, run it
Ayo, watch these 5 niggas stand up in triple pod
Circle back to back scoping all angles
Why does hip-hop circumference start gettin' tangled?
They drop one by one in the dark gettin' strangled
I come fresher than Summer's Eve please
Squeeze your wack-ass amphetamine rhyme drug-related
I'll make sure your loot and your wife and kid is confiscated
The lawnmower, Red do damage to circuit breakers
Go ahead and hype them niggas up, let 'em go
Just a blow from the invincible will show 'em I'm original
Freeze, I'm like Baskin and Robbin
I'm robbing Haagen-Dazs and the whole Hit Squad target
Ain't nobody fuckin' with me, the potency
That I blow from my mouth will no doubt would choke Jesus
Travelin' around the world with no Visas
Or American Express, just Jamerican Excess (ha!)
Can I impose on your cypher?
Been rippin' shows since moms was foldin' your diaper
Niggas see me up top, dolo daily
Catch E 600 V on the mobile trailin'
Back to ATL to swell some more heads
With that Long Island sound that be thicker than Cornbread's money
Jersey tales from from the hood without Sonny
And I know niggas want me, that's why my blade keep me company
Slice your neck, stick my arm down your throat
Rip out your artichokeEmbed
