BITE ME Lyrics
Ahhh!
I don't give a flying- Ahh!
 (x2)
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song? Oh well
You bore me to death

When I roll down my window
When I heard all those words words words from your mouth
Make me wanna run back, turn back, can I go back
Finna run back, straight in the house
When I reach for my headphones
Wanna hear boom boom pow b-b-boom boom pow
Everyone lost in space now
I wish they'd beam me up, then I turn this shit down
 (x2)
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song? Oh well
You bore me to death

Bite me, bite me
You can try me, try me
If you likey, likey
I don't give a f-f-f- Ahh!
Bite me, bite me
If you likey, likey
You can try me, try me
I don't give a f-f-f- Ahh!

When I get to work, smile until it hurts
All the boys hear like nothing that I said
Make me wanna run back, turn back
Where your mind at?
Wanna gun right straight to the end
Turning on the tube, better yet the news
Then I hear back and fourth, like a ping pong match
How they run, run in place now
Wish they'd beam me up cause I'm about to snap
You might also like (x2)
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song? Oh well
You bore me to death

Feels like I'm about to slip
Take control, then lose the grip
Feels like I'm about to slip
Under all your influence
Feels like I'm about to slip
Take control here, of me
Feels like I'm about to slip
Under all your influence
 (x2)
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song? Oh well
You bore me to death

Bite me, bite me
You can try me, try me
If you likey, likey
I don't give a f-f-f- Ahh!
Bite me, bite me
If you likey, likey
You can try me, try me
I don't give a f-f-f- Ahh!
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song? Oh well
You bore me to death
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song? Oh well
You bore me to death
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song?
I don't give a flying- Ahh! Ahh!
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song? Oh well
Sick of that song?
I don't give a flying- Ahh! Ahh!

Bitch! Bitch!
Haha! Haha!2Embed
