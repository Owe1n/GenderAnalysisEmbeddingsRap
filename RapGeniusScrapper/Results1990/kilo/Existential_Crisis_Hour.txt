Existential Crisis Hour! Lyrics
if you say I'm in control
and my actions serve to give my life a meaning,
does it have a meaning if I choose an action?
(No)
Are my goals necessary
or do they just serve as a way
to pass the time in an existence
that began outside of my control?
(No)
Does it matter? No
If I'm in my body
and you're in yours
with no way to swap,
How can we ever truly be together?
(Can't)
No matter how hard I press my face into yours
A space remains
so am I alone?
Yep
Nope
God no
If I can't choose to be born
and I'm meant to make my own rules
but I must die,
Is there a point?
No- Yes
If I can make up a point,
Is it valid?
Yes No
Can we all exist
with our set of purposes for living?
Yes
Is anyone wrong?
No, no
Is wrong even a factor?
No
Is any reality fixed?
No
Will I ever be able to see myself the way others see me?
No
Where does my personal bias limit me?
(everywhere)
Will you judge me for asking?
Yes, yeah
Should I care?
Nope, no
Is it you?
Is it me?
No
