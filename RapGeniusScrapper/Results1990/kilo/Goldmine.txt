Goldmine Lyrics
This phone isn't the greatest, well, for writing songs
But a vessel nonetheless for fantasies and shrouded thoughts
And as the light comes in and lays in wait across my wall
I gather all I've got and toss the veil once and for all
I'd like to say that it's just fine
Could never be a wasted night
5 AM before the light
And if you wake up feeling right
Just give me a call, it won't be awful
I lose sleep to think of you, I find it awesome
I've been looking pretty hard
But I come up empty
I've been thinking that the only one
For you, is me
Baby, baby
Babe

Laying here in bed, this blue pen and pad in hand
I try to face the fact that I think you're the one
I have just embraced the laughs and all the good fun that we've had
I want to tell you so, but I don't think you'd understand
You sure have a funny way of playing with emotions
Mixing up a strange little potion
Etched in red and number 9
Ten, eleven
And seven minutes in heaven
Think I'd kill to spin the bottle with you on the other side
Or even be at a party or when you didn't try
To hit on one of my friends only then to pass me by
Just give me a call, it won't be awful
I lose sleep to think of you, I find it awesome

You might also like
I've been looking pretty hard but I
I've been thinking bout the only one
I've been looking pretty hard but I
I've been thinking bout the only one
For you, is me
