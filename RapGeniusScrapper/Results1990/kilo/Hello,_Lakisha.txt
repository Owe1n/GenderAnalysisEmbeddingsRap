Hello, Lakisha LyricsMy name’s lakisha
Named after my dad
His name’s lakostia
Goes by coz
I go by kish
Because its shorter
And to me
A lot less obvious
At home my momma
She calls me kisha
But at the school yard
There were a million
When i was young
I needed freedom
And to feel
I stood out in this world
(too many girls)
Just. stand. out
I was sixteen
I wanted money
I put lakisha
On my resume
How funny
It was a joke
I found that no
One would call me back
Because of it
(oh shit)
I’ll tell you the truth
Like when i moved to new york
Nobody knew name
I put my head down and worked
Like 2 jobs at a time
Learned to read between the lines
I’ll say i’m kish on my resume
This time!
I was meant to be named india
After my greatest grandmother
(that's her name)
But someone had a baby first
And the name was
Given right to her
(what a shame)
I’d probably end up
A lot more conscious
I’d burn some incense
I’d pray to rocks and
Its hard to say
Who you would
Be if you were named
After somebody else
You might also likeBut i feel guilty
Stereotyping
Would have me leave it
Out of all and everything
Some people like
To assume different
But in truth
I'm not a bit ashamed
(it's my name)
When i sign my signature
Its with an “l”
And never with a “k”
You call me kilo
But lakisha
Forever will be my name5Embed
