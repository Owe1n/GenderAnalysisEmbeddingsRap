Taking Responsibility LyricsDon't know where to go
I guess we'll keep it on the low
'cause there's no cure anymore
So i guess we'll keep it on the low
I’ve seen some better days
Like hundreds of miles away
You gave me a brief escape
Now i just want
I want to go home
Don't know where to go
I guess ill keep it on the low
Cause there's just no cure anymore
But i guess ill keep it on the low
What's going on inside your head?
You left me unaware
You left me unaware
Unprepared!
I trusted you with my judgement
And you left me unaware!
You left me floating there
Drinking air
I'm so bummed i opened up
For you, for you
Simple times
No longer hear from you
From you, from you
You can man up if you want
You can come handle it pop
And you can remind me
That your down for me
Down for me yeah
You might also likeI can’t control these things
Or the way that
You feel about me
Damned if i was one!
Damned if i was one!
Damn if i was one!
