A Quarter to Cutthroat Lyrics
"Warning: the Surgeon General of Chilltown, New York has determined that the sounds you are about to hear can be devastating to your ear..."

Bring one MC, two MC, three MC
Send any MC, it don't matter to me
Step up like a thief in the night
No wins and I begin, my third eye is bright
Here to shine light, sky's the limit
On the DL who fell, yeah time will tell
The Leaders of the New, the number one crew
Blunts and brew for the Hip Hop stew
Girls got my picture, poster, pin-ups
Wanna skin up? Hey big up, big up!
It's a race against the clock, and I can't stop
Countdown hear the sound, C Boogie Brown
(Uptown Saturday night)
Yeah 125 we arrive so live from New York
Word life, you know I can kick it
At my show on the down low you're selling wolf-tickets
Ha ha the trigger, I'm trying to tell you now my nigga
I'm getting larger and bigger
One fourth the factor, here to Cackalacka
Crack that back like a chiropractor
Just a collective, my perspective
To be effective is the main objective
(Warriors come out and...)
Props, pay me say me nots
Any violations won't be tolerated
Let's not debate it, you hate it 'cause I made it
The loot, the boob tube, all that shit included
In a matter of seconds, you will be excluded
Checka check it out
East Coast Stomp in action
For rich or for poor we created the fashion
Left (foot), right (foot), stomp (stomp)
Leaders Of The New School, do the East Coast Stomp
It's a quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter to cutthroat
A quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter to cutthroat
A quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter to cutthroat
A quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter to cutthroat

It's the power of importance making people act as is
Compare fair from here to there, fair seems a little quiz
So question what I conquer, Scooby kills a kid
My friend got caught with a Luger, so now he does the bid
Bring 'em in, bring 'em in, see the clock on the wall
With one eye open Scarface to brawl
Panic seized, quarter cut squeezed to ten
Gave quarter back five with a minute to win
Then plenty of many men, with any if any trend
Came, rename, fame, shame the backspin
Speaking spic spans off spills of crack bins
So get your actions right, like craven jaws draw bite
Mars is mourned warned rating torn wound
A sprite bright lights the mics mix vega
A quart of water's what you get when your broke becomes bodega
Bothering, slobbering, ting-a-ling-a-ling (ding!)
Right on to Milo on the dot

Kicking right tonight and what's it not
You want strength, want strength, what? You really want strength
Milo in the dance deh pon jalippy long length
Now nuff respect to the second set
Seeking section for recovery
Who me a beg unno nah bother me, woy-oy!
Because I-yah, I am the one dem call the pum pum doctor
No bother get vex we coming a check your daughter
Ital punaani make the I feel better
Nah want fi put me wood inna de walls of fire
One step, two step, mek yuh reach lickle higher
Asking why oh why you have to make it bad so oh woy-oy!
Inna me khaki suit and ting
Love is all I bring
Inna the party, party respect to yardie
It's a rudeboy  for everybody
White, black, to Chinie pass the Heini
Onset, offset, no prisoners at war
A quarter to cutthroat is the New School law
(You better be in by sundown)
Sending death threats (huh) from miles around
Busta Bus down with the surround sound
Tick tock tick, ready for picking
Hip Hop easy listening
Time to take order 'cause it's a quarter to cut
What! What! What! Yo, you niggas can't front
You might also like
It's a quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter to cutthroat
A quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter to cutthroat

Yah! No more lucky charms for the malpractice tactics
Fiasco, Fiskell, Siskel and Ebert
Criticism, devilish exorcism
I strive to destroy and kill all inconsiderate organisms
Time will last only for the ones who bust that ass
All gridlock thinking, you better think fast
(Quick!)
Because I'm rifling down the stifling, trifling sound
Who's killing who, times killing you, stupid
You need to sweat yourself, don't sweat nobody else
I got my own perspiration, check the conversation
Minutes away, your ass is through dealing
Ha, smack yourself and find exactly what you're feeling
It's detrimental and essential that I chemistry thoroughly in my dimensional
Dungeon residential vicinity
Wack germs, you're like a cureless growing disease
Go and suck the clitoris of a trichamonis, discharge cheese
Ha, ease. Ha, substract counteract enemies, Ha
Carrying on while I be ripping and shredding
Getting fierce, gotta pierce the wack to stop the germs spreading
Before you striked, you caught a stroke
Now you're half-dead nigga, 'cause it's a quarter to cutthroat
Quarter to cutthroat
Quarter to cutthroat
Quarter to cutthroat
Quarter to cutthroat
Quarter to cutthroat
Quarter to cutthroat...1Embed
