Spontaneous (13 MCâ€™s Deep!) Lyrics
Holy smoking Joe, no jokes
I post no hoax for ya folks, no cocaine cokes
Cool whipper, whopper, wailing with Willis
Dealers do quills, quills do dillis
I'm ills like wills for the thrills of the phills nils phylis
My rap style kills, dead bodies stay stillest
'Cause Ben was my friend, he's the maniest
Cracker Jack Cool Whip spontaneous

Here we go
Brittle-ism organic organism schism
Kanism ism is I, will I, was I
Insanic poetical panic standing stanic
Illy silly, I made you hump a hillbilly
Kick your mother to Kansas, you hunchback hoodlum or hoody
Goody gets new tricks for rhyme flicks
My flattery battery bust nutters, got your girly in the buttus
Utters now your ho cakes sluttish
Well I'm feeling an astro flow to the afro and
Rumplin', tillin', skin in
Amazing loops filled with lyrical hoops
Peace to Betty Boops pass my GI-Gibaud's
Posing for the ha holy matrimony
I love ya Rosie Perez who said you had bulky legs
Call me daddy short dreads look at all the revolving beds
Kangaroos cold sportin' Pro-Keds

Rough rough I'm coming, flowing to the track
Look at the people throwing down in the crowd
Ah, pick up your pace and wiggle
Look at the girl's pum pum just jingle
Ooh jump off the stage and jet
E scoped the bitch that was sipping on a Beck's
Went to the flicks, oh was it rated X?
Pass it on to my boys and know they get wrecked

Extra, extra, read it, look what it's all about
I'm the Last Boy Scout
I turn it out any time that I can
My Master Plan is to do what's grand
I'm a rugged nigga, a big rugged nigga
Sit back and relax and take a swigga
Ramp is no joke
I'm on some shit called Cutthroat
Fuckin' with my boys watch you get your face broke
Ol' Chilly Willy
I think it's my time to play the rap Billy
Heyo Fellas where's the Phillie?
You might also like
Well well well, here I go again round two
Making brothers act (didi dum)
Having fun jettin' rhythms written by the one
I got the ultimate snap, I set lyrics like a trap
Rump a pum pum make the whole world shake
Quake to a new sound, tapes press play
Let me include the number one fact:
Trom is official, A.K. Blitz on the track

Remedy man yes I'm known as the Sha-Now
Remedy man, he's a Rumpletilskin
The moment is my ritual response is spontaneous
Now is now I grab the mic for a sec
Giving sponge baths to those who can't keep a rep
Didn't mean to turn you on
Fingers move faster than riffing rafts
Envision the Sha being bolder than your dad

Huh!
Unstoppable when my mind is amp
I'm a genie and the genie's coming from the lamp
Wizzy watch me get busy
40-ounce then hit the herb, vision is dizzy
Illy choco spillies into phillies
Causing mathematics static toolies in the attic
So brainwash the wish
'Cause this is, huh, spontaneous
All gyal with pum pum shorts please please come in
A mi say people are you ready
(Bo!) Oh lord
Kallie Weed come to rock steady
(Bo!) Oh lord
A long time unno did wait
But now me arrive upon de scene from now they asking
They're wondering why I am so mean
Never get me vex, me nah go cuss
Kick up rumpus
Hold it steady lyrics will full yuh belly
Remember this is Kallie Weed pon de version (Bo!)

What could ah mek unno think Milo could a gwan so
Me 'ave de lieutenant to de ding dong de ding dong de do
Say whether the riddim fast or whether de riddim slow
Me love fi chat pon de mic at party that is all I know
Short term long radius, it's the craziest
I can check for this when it's spontaneous

Yo, everybody anybody they want me
Mister brown skin, curly hair, mashed up teeth
Choices, voices funky Fahrenheit
Breaker, breakadawn, breaker, breaker, mic alright
Olympian Champion Timberland stomp
Stamp clamp amp, here I am here I am
Cali chronic, Brooklyn Buddha
New York City made this uh
Spontaneous

Immense lips the dale chips tales
Strip the street beats hopping hip healing hands
Over hot rocks, bop chops, stop hops
See I'm building on pop rocks with coke as a mouthwash
Gosh my old watch, what's mines meaning
Spot the dot give a lot red rose
Caligula screening sex
Spontaneous flex Bust I trust you be next

Yes, Yes
Do you see the unique boutique freaks
Many treats, gimme some sweets on the beats
Veronica, Sam, Wilma
Wack how do you figure
Stay away, stay away, you fucking gold digger
Direct from the union, rub me like a lotion
The solution, coming kind of stupid from the station
The chameleon, changing crazy styles like on the enormous
Let me focus, never bogus, spontaneousEmbed
