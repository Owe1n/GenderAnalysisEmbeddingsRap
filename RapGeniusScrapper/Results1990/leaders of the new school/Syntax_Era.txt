Syntax Era Lyrics
Dinco, Dinco, go Dinco
Go Charlie, Charlie go Charlie
Go Busta, Busta go Busta
You know we got style
Dinco, Dinco, go Dinco
Go Charlie, Charlie go Charlie
Go Busta, Busta go Busta
You know we got style

When it comes to shoutouts, Boogie Brown is here
Don't fear the clear, just step to it
Now I drive, come alive from the bottom to the top
Temptation or confusion makes you wanna stop, but
(I know you, and you know me)
CBMC, given to me, by Chuck D
That's deep as I look at all the videos
Wack stage shows, wack page flows
Biters, non-rhyme writers
(Example the sample)
It was an age under and a stage back
The girlies are screaming, they're having a cardiac
(Like epileptic seizure, no amnesia
Comatose, double dose anesthesia)
Damn (damn!) should I say what are you doing
I dare at your stare so yo come do me
It's done, or rather should I say it's on
The mental instrumental I continue with my song
Yeah, we've got jumping jerks
With no understanding of the East Coast Stomp
Fam understand, several other brothers
Watch our videos, the vidiots discover
(It's just another case)
Wow! Bass!
Why is everybody always picking on me
Now let's see, your game is played, B
I'm Donkey Kong fat freak the notes, flip the script run the jewels
(The Leaders Of The New School)
Yet I shine when I rhyme (you know, you know)
Always remember the scenario

For the Harper Valley Pete's sake, tea makes a great
Ace in a hole, when you cheated out of gold
Only sold to who was told
Now I'm trembling, remembering when I was Timberland down
(Listen wait, who's that coming around?)
Sounds like that sound
I guess it's Dinco, Milo, Busta, and Brown
Four minds of two kinds, run one with the sun
I love my father, my mother, my brothers, and the sisters that come
From all over the place and trace the bass
Inspector Clouseau
Yo I wonder is it true though, oh no here we go
No more security nets
Straight human casualties call for raw regrets
In the beat societies, lessons must speak
Stand be strong, keep away from weak
In the years long life leaders let loose
Leading left-backs and misguided youth
Letting leaks lack levels of truth
Look ma no hands
Lend likes lots of love only lasting 'cause I'm asking
Could we be above, average not savage
But near newly making duty, more than terror?
Peace to my girl, whoops syntax error

You know we got-

Copy cat do this, do that
Wanna do something, do this
Chicky chaka Chewbacca, gitty getty gotcha!
Ah man, all of a sudden people say I be bugging
Rugged culture musical Hip-Hop I be loving
Gimme gimme gimme something, gimme something for nothing
Rich bloodsucker of the poor I see you
Hickory dickory hey, watch out for the trickery
What happened to creativity, dignity, integrity?
Hey Mister Sneaky-One, don't try to read my mind
Just worry about getting yours because I'm getting mine
(Leaders made a commitment to keep this type of music living forever)
Whatever, whatever, we live in an era
Where errors aren't made to remain an error
But I think that's kinda better
Understand that word and how you use it
Rap is business music, Hip Hop is cultural music
Now you get to see the ones, oh yeah it's super dumb
Dance around because you know that we doing it for fun
Flipping and tripping, you little sorry sucker you slipping
Lay over my lap because I'm gonna give you a whipping
Tripping, dipping and whining, stop the damn crying
I don't know what you trying, you better stop lying
With correct intellect, whether bigger and better
As you come straight, check out my syntax error
Word to God, 1993, shit is solid
We are the L (What!)
We are the O (What!)
We are the N (What!)
We are the S (What!)
