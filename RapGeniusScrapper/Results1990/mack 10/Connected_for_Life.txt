Connected for Life Lyrics

I jump out the blocks like ready, set, go!
Check all my traps and dodge the fed co
I'm all up in the mix like a fuckin’ collage
And out the garage is a Bentley Onage
With the brains blowed out, so the sun's beamin’
I got the jackers droolin’, and the hoes fiendin’
And since I'm Westside Connected got the streets on hype
I got big deals, big skrill, big wheels, big pipes
Twenty-inchers roll, go and get these hoes
Picky hoes wanna roll with my niggaroles
But be a freak about it, and I'ma see about it
Speak about it, no, bitch, I'ma be about it
Who want some of this? West runnin’ this
Mack 10 with the Playboy Bunny bitch
She's a dummy bitch with a money pit
You broke-ass niggas can't even stomach this

What that connect like? Nigga three-time felon
Six-double-0-west sellin’ rich 
Throw it up, hold it up, gun bust fo' fingers up
Two twisted in the middle with the thumb cuffed
Chevy Nash and dippin’ the ass and king of the zaggin’
Fo'-fo' Mag and the toe taggin’
Dub the hood phantom, in a blue Phantom
In front of the club and valet, go for talk and a magnum, trick

What is it like, tossin' them hoes?
And rollin' on fools on them foes
Flossin' them chains, we doin' big thangs
And bustin' on punks at close range
This the way us gangstas roll
Sit back and watch as it unfolds
Bitches and suckers stunt so cold
Ah, this is the life we chose
You might also like
Dope money and rappin’, shit, I'm all with it
And all I know is the street so that's how I spit it
Chickenhawk see a bird, then I gotta get it
So if ya hood come up short, then I probably did it
And if lil' momma thick then I gotta hit it
The Trojan gotta be a Magnum for me to fit it
If it was sherm on a stick then I probably lit it
The red beam is on your wig so I probably split it

To all the bitches that think they bootylicious
I think they nutritious, I think they do dishes
I'm makin’ three wishes, or takin' they pictures
And spendin' they riches and fuckin' they bitches
Egomaniac, little homies call me brainiac
Ice Cube's an asshole and it ain't an act
So take a hit of that, and remember that
Where my motherfuckin’ niggas and my bitches at?

Tree-i-ick! I'm Dub-C, the rider with the clique
And like a dragon it's nathin' but fire when I spit
And I can't shake these ghetto ways
A street-rich nigga eatin’ a bag of Lays, some rubber bands, some braids
From the turf for the side, rings an ambulance
Where we keep the pistols smokin’ like Afghanistan
It's the gangsta, the killa, the dope dealer back for more figgas
So trick bow down and po' the liquor, bitch
What is it like, tossin' them hoes?
And rollin' on fools on them foes
Flossin' them chains, we doin' big thangs
And bustin' on punks at close range
This the way us gangstas roll
Sit back and watch as it unfolds
Bitches and suckers stunt so cold
Ah, this is the life we chose
What is it like, tossin' them hoes?
And rollin' on fools on them foes
Flossin' them chains, we doin' big thangs
And bustin' on punks at close range
This the way us gangstas roll
Sit back and watch as it unfolds
Bitches and suckers stunt so cold
Ah, this is the life we chose

It's plain to see, you can't change me
‘Cause I'ma be connected for life
It's plain to see, you can't change me
‘Cause I'ma be connected for life

Yeah, West Connect gang for life
Butch Cassidy
Mannie Fresh, you a fool for this beat, boy
Uh, uh, uhEmbed
