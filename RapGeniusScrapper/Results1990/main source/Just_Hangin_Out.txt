Just Hanginâ€™ Out Lyrics
I'm just hangin' out
I'm just hangin' out

I'm mainly known for the rough raps
But kids steal my lyrics like hubcaps
And eat 'em like stacks of flapjacks like Rugrats
Hey, and I get busy over unknown tracks
While the next man flaps his lids like Parkay
I'm skilled in the field, so slide to the side
I'll make a rapper cry, 'cause I can get some shut-eye
While he's havin' hard times writin' rhymes
So he gnaws on my metaphors and dines on my lines
Which is the reason why I like to hang out
And hustle with my friends, to get away from pens
And copiers, so I'm Corona bound
To check Drew a.k.a Doc the Butcher, and what's goin' down
And Joe with the Jetta enables us to get around town, he's a clown
Other than that, I'm with Joe Burgos
Watch an old Black Caesar flick for kicks
Jump in the wagon and we're outta here without an idea of where
But usually we wind up there
I go over K-Cut's block 'cause rock cuts is what he blends
Check it, and I like to hang out and hustle with my friends
I'm just hangin' out
I'm just hangin' out

And I be up in Mt. Vernon, piecin', with CL Smooth and Pete Rock
Makin' beats that are sharper than cleats
With my man Grippy Grip from the Cafe Black Rose
Checkin' out videos
And I speak with my man Ralik
On the problems of the weak, dumb and meek, my man's deep
Like the kid from the Bridge named the rapper Nas
Me and G collect money in bars
And I run through discotheques like sound
Royal Rich is profound, yellin' "Free James Brown!"
We rustle up to the discotheque and
Hustle up a storm in a swarm like we gonna form
Nobody can get with the whereabouts 'cause we're out
Shufflin' feet without a shadow of a doubt
From Flushing to the streets of New York and back
Freshly dipped off the rack, but not the Van Grack
In the park, makin' plans for the night
Everything's right, takin' it light
Preparin' for the festivities to begin
And every day seems like a day from the weekend
The coolin' never ends
And I like to hang out and hustle with my friends
