It's the Rikki, here we go, -Tikki-Tavi
Yo my dick be, brown like Bobby
I'll be fryin'
Heads with my scientifical
Mind, your brain cells are fryin'
Flying, flackin', packin' a tour
Mackin', jackin', smackin' a whore
So fuck Lodi Dodi or, any other hottie, uh
I get wrecked like the planes at La Guardia
I'm rowdy like Roddy Piper, I'm hyper
Type of guy to let it fly like a sniper
Viper, flashin', slashin' a verse and
(Here's Lord Digga, nigga, black like a hearse and
Cursin' crazy, dirty ass mouth
My dick is longer than 95-South)
Damn, I'm teed off like Howie, like Roxanne I'm real
Plus I'm the Master who talk what he feel
Like a eel, electrifyin', I'm tryin' to
Stop the madness, the black man is dyin'
Word up, dialect for the dome
I live in a cage but the cage ain't my home
I'm a chrome down and a wide body kit
I'm bold like that shit you wash your clothes with
So sit down and check how I am
But that's not who I am
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four
That is the sound when it's time to go to war
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four
That is the sound when it's time to go to war
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four
That is the sound when it's time to go to war
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four
That is the sound when it's time to go to war
Follow me and
Follow me and a...
Everybody, everybody, follow me and a...
Follow me and
Follow me and a...
Everybody, everybody, follow me and...

You wanna go to war with the nigga then you're sick
I'm quick with the hut one, two that I kick
Ass, pumpin' like gas through your town
And I won't turn my jungle music down
You can call it what you want but I came to cause a commotion
Check out the flow son, you might get the notion
To run but you cannot hide, there's no escapin'
The super-duper, hero with a cape and
Your son bought my tape and
You're wanted for raping, my mother
My culture, you just left a gapin' hole
I'm in control like Marley
I'm crashing my jeep into your bullshit Harley
So get off the road rednecks here I come
With 121 kids from the slums, gettin' dumb
Brooklyn, the Bronx, Watts, Queens, Compton, and 20 other spots
Yo, I be writin' up the mad composition
Mission to uplift black man's position
Then go fishin', and catch me a whale
A great big white one, and put him on sale
If I fail, I'm gonna go back, and
Put 'em in jail, and make 'em smoke crack, and
Get 'em off track and, even up the score
Attack his daughter, and treat her like a whore
Fool! Masta Ace is the kid
Makin' sure that the punk mother F'ers get did
You might also like
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four
That is the sound when it's time to go to war
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four
That is the sound when it's time to go to war
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four
That is the sound when it's time to go to war
Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut four
That is the sound when it's time to go to war
Follow me and
Follow me and a...
Everybody, everybody, follow me and...
Follow me and

Everybody, everybody, follow me and...
Follow me and

Everybody, everybody, follow me and...

Everybody, everybody, follow me and...

That is the sound when it's time to go to war
That is the sound when it's time to go to war
That is the sound when it's time to go to war

That is the sound when it's time to go to war
That is the sound when it's time to go to war
That is the sound when it's time to go to war
That is the sound when it's time to go to warEmbed
