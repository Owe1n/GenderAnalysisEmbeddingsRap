I’ll Be There For You/You’re All I Need To Get By (Razor Sharp Mix) Lyrics
Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny

You're all (You're all)
I need (All I need)
To get by (To get by)
Ahh (Ahh)
You're all (You're all)
I need (All I need)
To get by (Yeah yeah)
Ahh (Ooh ooh)
Shorty, I'm here for you anytime you need me
For real, girl, it's me in your world, believe me
Nothin' make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothin'
You made a brother feel like he was somethin'
That's why I'm wit' you to this day, boo, no frontin'
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say, "Baby, it'll be okay"
Now, that's real to a brother like me, baby
Never, ever give my pussy away, and keep it tight, a'ight?!
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a phat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life, you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we
Be livin' in the fuckin' lap of luxury
I'm realizin' that you didn't have to fuck wit' me
But you did, now I'm goin' all out, kid
And I got mad love to give
You my nigga

You're all (You're all)
I need (Oh oh)
To get by (You're all)
Ahh (All I need)
You're all (You're all)
I need (Oh oh)
To get by (All I need)
Ahh (All I need)
You might also like
I got a love jones for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone, I'm already on the bone
Plus, I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around, you got the good shit at home
Even if I'm locked up North
You in the world rockin' three-fourths of cloth
Never showin' your stuff off, boo
It be true, me for you, that's how it is
I can be your Noah, you can be my Wiz
Then I could be your Sun, you can be my Earth
Resurrect the God through birth, best believe

You're all that I need, I'll be there for you
If you keep it real with me, I'll keep it real wit' you
Lovin' your whole steez, it be in there, boo
On top of that, you got the good Power-U!
You're all that I need, I'll be there for you
If you keep it real with me, I'll keep it real wit' you
Lovin' your whole steez, it be in there, boo
On top of that, you got the good Power-U
(You're all ... I need ... to get by ... ahh)

You're all (You're all)
I need (All I need)
To get by (Yeah yeah)
Ahh (Ooh)
You're all (You're all)
I need (All I need)
To get by (To get by)
Ahh (Ahh)
You're all (You're all)
I need (All I need)
To get by
Ahh (You're all)
You're all (You're all)
I need (Oh)
To get by (All I need)
