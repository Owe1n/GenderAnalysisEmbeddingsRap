Release Yo’ Delf Lyrics
When I first stepped on the scene, niggas was petrified
Jet back to the lab like they were being chased by homicide
My rap flow does you right, Tical
And it will never steer you wrong
And all you bitch-ass niggas in the industry
Your careers won't be lasting long
When I first stepped on the scene, niggas was petrified
Jet back to the lab like they were being chased by homicide
My rap flow does you right, Tical
And it will never steer you wrong
And all you bitch-ass niggas in the industry
Your careers won't be lasting long
Check it, I'm the fuckin' man, who they mention
Noticed that other niggas rap styles is bogus
Doodoo compared to this versatile voodoo
Blazin', the stuff that ignites stimulation
Inside ya, 'cause I be that household provider
Providin' the rhyme that be deep as The Poseidon Adventure
Niggas need to test they freakin' tincture
For the sickness that be spreadin' with the quickness
Remedies, cousin, I be doing on my enemy
Penalty, then I drink forties to they memories
Emotion, coursin' through your town street vicinity
Blunt smoke in the air reveals my identity

(Tical.... tical... ti-cal, ti-cal...)
As I keep it movin', we keep it movin', uh
Keep it movin', and keep it movin', uh
Keep it movin', baby, we be movin', uh
Keep it movin', we keep it—huh, rhahhrh!

What's that rhythm, what's that sound?
Party people gettin' down
When it hit no doubt about
Just release yo' delf
You might also like
My God, somebody said, it's on—if it is, then I'll be set
To blow a nigga up with my five fingers of death
I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand if you frontin'
On any man down with the Clan, I be comin'
For the headpiece, you can't cope
For my brother, I bring it to the Pope, word to mother
Serial killer style from the Isles of Stat'
My peoples are you with me, where you at?
Shit's gettin' deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas lookin' all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the floor
That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no more
What is it? Niggas think they bigger
Because they got their finger on the trigger of a biscuit
They don't know I'm wicked when I start to kick it
Eat they raw sound, wash it down with a Mistic
Better yet a Snapple
Nigga want the juice but he don't want the hassle
When we try to overthrow the castle
Better yet the temple I'm coming to your town black down
The rental car, the pistol cocked
If you don't want to burn from the Glock
Then beware, I buck shots, meanin' what?
The buck stops here, no more dough will be made
Unless it's bein' made by who?
What's that rhythm, what's that sound?
Party people gettin' down
When it hit no doubt about
Just release yo' delf

(Tical.... tical... ti-cal, ti-cal...)
As I keep it movin', we keep it movin', uh
Keep it movin', and keep it movin', uh
Keep it movin', baby, we be movin', uh
Keep it movin', we keep it—huh, rhahhrh!

When I first stepped on the scene, niggas was petrified
Jet back to the lab like they were being chased by homicide
My rap flow does you right, Tical
And it will never steer you wrong
And all you bitch-ass niggas in the industry
Your careers won't be lasting long

Throw your hands in the sky
And wave them from side to side
And if you’re ready to spark up the Meth Tical
Let me hear you say "stimuli"

When I first stepped on the scene, niggas was petrified
Jet back to the lab like they were being chased by homicide
My rap flow does you right, Tical
And it will never steer you wrong
And all you bitch-ass niggas in the industry
Your careers won't be lasting long4Embed
