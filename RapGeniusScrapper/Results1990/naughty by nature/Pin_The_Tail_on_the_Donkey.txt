Pin The Tail on the Donkey Lyrics
Oh finally, finally (Here we are)
And for good are the three, follow me (It ain't far)
Even though if it was, you could make it to the start
The enemies, do you know who they are? (There they are)
A devil with the durags be walkin', now I had it up to there
Oh yeah, that's the last straw (The Nature's back for)
(Brothers and sisters, round, ugh, ugh)
Pin the tail on the junkie, find a false flavor
It's a new day to play with a neighbor
Freeze the MCs that wanna see thee
By now Naughty By Nature by me
They want me to come in comin' up faster, that could be arranged
That won't last to the master now, 'cause they couldn't stand the damn rain
The pain's the same, the game remains mine
I got more hooks than a fish line
Bite the head off the snake
Chew up from the first to last break, then shoot 'em in the face
Make way (Move), who are you to test me? (Huh, huh, huh)
I seen your last porno flick, it ain't impress me
What's up? Cuddle, sport, here's a thought
(The only records that they got are the records they crew bought)
Damn real, V-Rock, their fiendin' is funky
Pin the tail on the donkey
(Bring that beat back)
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

I do more poppin' than a blackhead, bread for waxheads
I'm fed (Go ahead, you retired tackhead)
Back to the fact of the track with a new thought
You couldn't smoke butts with a match and a Newport
Here we go, we go, we go again, with a flow we know, we know it's in
(Def play like Papa Simpson)
KayGee's on the slice, can he co-clean?
Doin' more scratchin' than a funk and a dope fiend
Cold knockin' blocks off, gettin' rocks off
I don't cock off, cop out, I knock cops off (Cops off)
Another renegade of rap, oh, stop that
I'm more feared than a Sugar Hill contract
I'm known for lettin' the hoes go, my demo's all flow
When cursin' was a no-no, you dodo
Give it up 'cause I'm hot with a warm hate
I won't stop, pop 'til that head is screwed on straight
I take shorts and no sorts, so take that, clone
The only thing I take is the A to the PATH home
And I take it all the way to the north stop
Your style's more foul than a pork chop
I rock the hip-hop, nonstop tick-tock
Around the big clock, with a spot, tick-tock
Pin the tail on the jackass, it don't mean jack (Chill)
To a brother from down the hill
Backtrack with a rap that remains funky
(Hmm, and it's funky)
Back in the day, y'all, I played with Play-Doh
The dough is real now, and dildos feel how
A starvin' hungry MC gets when
MC filet mignon is the fixin'
I'm starvin' up, it's time to carve them up, yup
Get 'em and cut 'em up, stuff 'em and cook the duck
Tough luck, tell 'em to shut up and jet
And feel the threat of a real life roughneck
Pin the tail on the donkey

(Can I get a witness?)

Check, check, where you, where you bet, bet
That another best will need a head vest for this head-check
(Wait, there's another Treach?), that's what I heard, yep
Three steps from a bllt-boom in his chest
I never knew a nigga really wanted to die
Instead of even instead of lookin' me eye-to-eye, then I
Knew he was truly through, dumb plus the one
To meet the mighty one, call a bad one
I rhyme about what I want to, microphone one-two
You do more light glosserin' than a bum do
T-H-E-M-C-O-F R-A-P-T-O-L-double-O-K
A-Tï»¿-I-N-T-H-E N-I-N-E-T-I-E-apostrophe-S, see
And I might stop to step to a sexy
Fancy, prancy, and dancy
No cosmo stomp, here's the true form
Style so fat, it gets fitted with a shoe horn
Here's a clearer mirror, dear ya
Look at it nearer, 'cause I don't fear ya
Some get too souped to the point
Where the stew too thick, but still lick through and through
I always wanted a guy to come and try
To get sly and try to get by my
Edit the treacherous style that's wreckin' it
Pin the tail on the donkey
What the?
Yo, yo, yo, what's up, yo? (What happened?)
Oh, it's like that?
We gon' rush you again
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go2Embed
