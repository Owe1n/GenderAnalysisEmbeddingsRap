All We Got Iz Us (Evil Streets) Lyrics
Nigga you heartless? You ain't heartless
You don't want no part in this
You ain't got it in ya, I’m born to be a sinner
As I move through these evil New York streets
Like grease, and some kids get caught up
All up in the crime rate, couldn’t hold your 9 straight
When you was busting your whole clip and hit nothing
Your whole block got hot up, only two niggas got up
Came down fast, caught the cash and the product
Caught you pants down with your clothes off
A nigga never knows, a nigga never doze off
Ya got your rhymes niggas? Bring em, we stomp that
Its concrete combat where I'm at
A crime covered city
Where there's no time for pity
We coming from the village
Of the unprivileged
Blood soaked bills through murder actions
Transactions all illegal
I smell the cheeb like a beagle
Evil stalks and lurks, dominate and do works in my dwelling
Niggas spilling shells and compelling to bust melons
We just fugitives and felons so ain’t no telling

These evil streets is rough
Ain’t no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
Cause all we got is us
These evil streets is rough
Ain’t no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
Cause all we got is us
These evil streets…

I see the world through the eyes of a nigga on a brink
Drugs got my brain fried making it hard to think
And I’m trapped in these evil streets
Driving some scuffed up ran down beat up ass Timbs
Some kid pulls up with chrome dipped Bugatti rims
Now I’m thinking it’s three in the A.M. 
I’m walking, he in a B.M. drop top three
And don’t even see me, but you gon' believe he saw my gun in 3D
10 blocks later I'm trying to work the CD
Spotted 50 dipped on the BQE
Cause ain't no way them pigs is bagging me
Next up is Sonsee, we Afficial Nastee
You might also like
For niggas that force the issue, my man’ll toss the pistol
And of course I hit you, let that loss be with you
The more L’s the higher, streets of fire
Make ice hearts in men for a worldly desire
It’s the black attack born on the corner
Nigga grew up fast to get that loot up, ready to shoot up
And he do anything to achieve it
Ya better believe it
Run with a band of thieves who retrieves the goods
Stacking stacks and push a nigga shit back like they should
While we was gone some shit done developed
Now parlay, sit back and watch Armee swell up
Yeah, punk niggas

These evil streets is rough
Ain’t no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
Cause all we got is us
These evil streets is rough
Ain’t no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
Cause all we got is us
These evil streets is rough
Ain’t no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
Cause all we got is us
These evil streets is rough
Ain’t no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
Cause all we got is us
As we move through these evil streets…
Only nigga that could kill me is the nigga in the mirror
And when I cuff a mic it make my fighting words clearer
I’m naked without a gun, it’s like something is missing
That was my employer when I ain’t have a pot to piss in
So listen
Keep a gun even if it’s not needed
Better that than to have none and be in deep shit
We mold on niggas like Bacteria grows
Foes be lucky if they walk away with a black eye and a broken nose

Nigga, we kill niggas for Polo and Hilfigers
It’s all for real ill niggas with steel triggers
Ain’t nothing over here pumping soft, shit be jumping off
On the reg
Don’t beat me in the head with that, go ahead with that
I think back, me and my man’s brother, we robbed somebody grandmother
Pulled out, the bitch ran for cover
Keep niggas guessing with a face without expression
For niggas stressing, I leave a lifetime impression
It shines like fluorescents when the flame comes out
It’s all about what you got when your game runs out, shit is hot
You can get burned with heat, we take turns to sleep, you better learn the street knowledge
Damn, you can get shot for five dollars
It’s live wires with no signs of survivors

These evil streets is rough
Ain’t no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
Cause all we got is us
These evil streets is rough
Ain’t no one we can trust
Either roll with the rush or get rushed
Cause all we got is us
These evil streets...4Embed
