NFL Jams (1999) Lyrics
Here they come, here they come
Here they come, here they come
Here they come, here they come
Here they come, here they come
Check it out, here we go
Ride on out
Yo, it's about that time
Comin' break through the line
You know you can't run, brought down to one
Whatcha gon' do, comin' through, comin' through
Now say, hut two hut two
Yes once again, one mo' game, in the place to be
It's the boys from way down south
Backed up by Jay's D
I know you really wanna get wild
I know you wanna get loose now
Ain't no shame to my game
I gotta raise the roof and that's the truth
Clap your hands, stomp your feet
Feel the power in the street
Got you comin' outta your seat
From the bottom to the top
We goin' all the way
To the bowl here we go
You know we came to play
Now whatchu say
Alright, alright
Now whatchu gon' do
Just pump it up
Alright alright
Keep comin' straight for you, play that
1 - 	Oh here we come, here we come
	You said you want it, now we 'bout to be your fun
	It's about that time, headed straight for you
	The boys down south, comin' through, comin' through
You might also likeGet ready
Here they come, here they come
Get ready
Here they come here they come
Get ready
Here they come here they come
Get ready, here they come

Uh oh, watch out, here I come
The big bad brotha oughtta bring you some
All the pain that I bring on the field
When you hear the word Nealy think
Break through the safty valve
Break it down, nutha words break it out
If that don't work then I take you down
You felt the rest now feel the best

So who's y'all wanna see
It's Daryl Gardner you know it's me
I keep more coming like Michael Mark, fire
Make you searchin' for tires
Runnin' through ways to make you well
Thirty two ways to break you down
Thirty two ways to give you some
Uhoh watch out, cuz here I come
Let Ant just ride out
You won't stay for lunch, I'm gon' try it out
My wonderful feel in microphone, uh
When we stop, the mic is gone
Like this dat, dat and this
Miami's down here on the trial
But I just couldn't miss it
Swing it over like a cherry y'all
And after this verse gon' meet her at the Marriott
Repeat 2
Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Break it down one time
Whassup with '89
I ain't that hard to find
I what y'all ride the pine
I bust through lines like a maniac
Prayer ain't gon' bring you back
Let's all start the eulogy
Now what the hell ya gon' do with me

In the middle of the field the stadium's packed
The crowd was roarin', the time to attack
30 long, what it gon' be
I'm comin' round the corner for the QB	
Can't run or hide from the take down "D"
Make another team, still like Queens, I'm mean
From Miami, this is Anderson and the QCD
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing
Ain't gon' stop till I get another ring, now
Repeat 2
Check it out, here we go
Ride on out
Yo, it's about that time
Comin' break through the line
You know you can't run, brought down to one
Whatcha gon' do, comin' through, comin' through
Now say, hut two hut two, that's it
Repeat above until fadeEmbed
