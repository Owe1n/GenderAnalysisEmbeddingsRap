I Am the Body Beautiful Lyrics
And where is the body?
Aw yeah, don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
And where is the body?
Move over mutha 'cause I'm going faster than you can drive
The body's beautiful, baby
That's right, I just can't help it
It's not my fault, I was born this way
I was born this way

Get with the B-E-A-U-T-Y
Beauty, the body is beautiful
Body beautiful
Get with the B-E-A-U-T-Y
Beauty, the body is beautiful
I am body beautiful
I'm up and coming, I am a child
I'm legendary, hey, I'm free and wild
I am the ocean, and I rule the world (the whole world)
I'm sensual, I am body beautiful (the body's beautiful)
My cha-cha pumps (hump-a-dooty), I've got them on (in a winnin' ticket)
And I work the runway (left-right-left-right-left), baby, all night long
I am the one (the only one), there is no other
I am mother
I am body beautiful

Get with the B-E-A-U-T-Y
Beauty, the body is beautiful
Body beautiful
Get with the B-E-A-U-T-Y
Beauty, the body is beautiful
I am body beautiful

Lights, camera, action!
Satisfaction guaranteed, that's what I need
I celebrate the body and enjoy good health
And I gets down with my bad self
It's all good from the front to the back
Two snaps and a clap for a body like that
It's a good damn thing I don't care what you say
Somebody beautiful (I am body beautiful), hey, that's me
You might also like
I am grand (grand diva), I am the queen (Queen Bee)
A masquerade (who am I?), I'm fantasy (you're a fantasy)
I am the house (the whole mansion) of elegance
Featuring, I am body beautiful (body beautiful)

Get with the B-E-A-U-T-Y
Beauty, the body is beautiful
Body beautiful
Get with the B-E-A-U-T-Y
Beauty, the body is beautiful
I am body beautiful

Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful
Everybody's beautiful in their own special way (yes)
Carry yourself like a queen and you will attract a king
Beauty comes from within (yes)
Whatever the mind can conceive and believe
You will achieve (got to believe)
Do you believe (yes) that you are body beautiful?
Yes!  Yes!  Oooo, yes!

There ain't enough words to express how I feel
I'm body beautiful, true, that's for real
Am who I am and that's all I can be
Open up your mind so your eyes can see
Body beautiful, baby (Work that body)
Body beautiful, baby (Work it, work it)
Body beautiful, baby (Work that body)
Body beautiful that's me (word)
Then I'm-a tell ya like this, and I'm-a tell ya this way
My body's beautiful, that's all I'm sayin'
Bodies come in all different shapes and sizes
You're beautiful, too, just realize this
Can't you see the beauty in me?
Open up your heart and set your mind free
Everybody's beautiful in their own way
Express yourself every day
And when you got joy on the inside it shows on the out
Be confident and you're beautiful without a doubt
You're absolutely gorgeous, don't ya know?
So you got the body beautiful glow
Body beautiful, baby (Work that body)
Body beautiful, baby (Work it, work it)
Body beautiful, baby (Work that body)
Body beautiful (I am body beautiful) that's me (word)
Get with the B-E-A-U-T-Y
Beauty, the body is beautiful
Body beautiful
Get with the B-E-A-U-T-Y
Beauty, the body is beautiful
