Cabin Stabbin Lyrics
Now this happen to be a special dedication to all the girl who waan' di most loving ting
Youths and youth, what you thinking?
Change your thinking, those who supporting mister thinking must a think is Titanic sinkin'

Stabbin' cabin, for, dis a stabbin' cabin (An')
Stabbin' cabin, for, dis a stabbin' ca- (Bim!)
Stabbin' cabin, for, dis a stabbin' (Mi say)
Tell mi, mister Natchilous, what is di meanin'?

Come down Junior Demus, di ruff neck chicken (Cah!)

Pack up some stone an' stone di cabin (Him want to)

Say, please, mister Cat, beca' mi want you let mi in
If you don't let mi in mi a go light di buildin'

Now, mister Demus, no do such a thing
Man, go try some deep sea fishin'
Go catch a little sprat or go catch a marlin ('Cause)
Cabin stabbin', it is a serious ting
Cabin stabbin' is a one man ting
So, mister Demus, go try another ting
'Cause, dis is not a sprat an' it's not a ballin'
It is Super Cat and Junior Demus stylin'
Mi have di brown ting an' she well seasonin' (She seasonin')Embed
