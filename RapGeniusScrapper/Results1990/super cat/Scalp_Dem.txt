Scalp Dem Lyrics
Well hear wicked man say them riding west
Tell them that them buck up inna Lord Jesus horse
And Jungle Jesus gun and the Apache dem who line up head
And lick off chest, no guy test
Hear wha' we tell them!

Well I can see unuh disappointment, Bounty Hunter Killer cowboy, unuh claim that unuh riding West
And a guy a run off him mout', and a big up him chest 'bout Apache dem come fi distress
But make me tell unuh this
Unuh make sure God a unuh bulletproof vest
'Cause when mi pop off and splurt anyting weh come fi test, mi say, them gone underground fi go rest
Make me tell you 'bout scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Me a go scalp dem...
And hang dem up high

Indian from all direction
Surround the whole of dem inna di Grand Canyon
Nesbert, Cherokee, and Cheyenne
Capture outlaw raiders and Bounty Killer gang
Him woman a fi di Wild Indian
Me take the money and the gold, and burn the wagon
Rush up John Wayne an' the one Levon
Him cavalry friend, we burst them one by one
And they rest of them me have under detention
Tell them that Apache run the Western land

Me a go scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Me a go scalp dem
Y-y-y-you a hear me man?

Well I can see unuh disappointment, Bounty Hunter Killer cowboy, a di first time unuh riding West
A guy a run off him mout', and a big up him chest 'bout Apache dem come distress
But make me tell unuh this
Mi say, no hurry-come-up shooter cyan test
'Cause when mi pop off and a splurt all cowboy dem disturb, and di whole town under distress

And let me tell you 'bout scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Me a go scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Me a go scalp dem..
And hang dem up high

A bwoy a talk 'bout, I bet the bwoy cyan try
'Bout him, "shoot Apache Chief and him feather did a fly"
Him must have shot a bald eagle from out of di sky
Cast him!!!! And hang him up high
Bring fire dance, and now the bwoy die
Him woman, she bow down and a cry
And when she start cry she hear shots multiply
We kill two outlaw and we scalp in July
We let go Eli, 'cause Eli no fi die
We let go Josey Wales and the worl' know why
We sign a treaty, after the war sign nuh die
But if a boy slip, we kill and sound fly
And we a go scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
And we a go scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
And we a go scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
And me a go scalp dem..
And hang dem up high

Well I can see unuh disappointment, Bounty Hunter Killer cowboy, unuh claim that unuh riding West
A guy a run off him mout', and a big up him chest 'bout Apache dem come distress
But make me tell unuh this
Unuh make sure God a unuh bulletproof vest
'Cause when mi pop off and splurt anyting weh come fi test, mi say, them gone underground fi go rest

Make me tell you 'bout scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Scalp dem
Scalp dem, and hang dem up high
Scalp dem..
'Cause tonight dem a go dieEmbed
