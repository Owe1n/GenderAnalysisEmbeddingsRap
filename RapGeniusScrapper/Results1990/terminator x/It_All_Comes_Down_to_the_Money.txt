It All Comes Down to the Money Lyrics
It all comes down to the money
Whether it's rainy or snowy or sunny
Funny, but it all comes down to the money
I'm in it
I'm in it for the cash
I'm in it for the cash

I got a girl, but she's only mine some of the time
'Cause some of the time she's hard to find
Especially when my pockets ain't lookin' correct
She ain't lookin correct, she ain't havin' no respect
'Cause back in the days I wasn't all that wack
I wouldn't call that wack when I was Jimmy Mack
The ends would never end and I had mad friends
But I had mad friends 'til the ends were spent
Now my girl is Audi like Jetta, yo
She's only Jetta cause my dough was low
Now she's on the hunt like a little stunt
Like a little stunt, but the truth is kinda blunt
It all comes down to the money
Whether it's rainy or snowy or sunny
Funny, but it all comes down to the money
I'm in it
I'm in it for the cash
I'm in it for the cash
It all comes down to the money
Whether it's rainy or snowy or sunny
Funny, but it all comes down to the money
I'm in it
I'm in it for the cash
I'm in it for the cash

It all comes down to money
It all comes down to money
And, it all comes down to money
It all comes down to money, and

My man is my man only some of the time
'Cause some of the time he's like hard to find
An on the down low type of business man
The type of business man who doesn't really have a plan
Livin' kinda hard for a lot of his days
It seems that nowadays he has the phrase that pays
Seal it in the vial as he calls it a dime
And it's good for a dime, but he don't call it a crime
Until he got knocked by the D.E.A
And now the D.E.A. went and took the kid away
And now I never see him while he do a bid
While he do a bid - here's the real truth, kid

It all comes down to the money
Whether it's rainy or snowy or sunny
Funny, but it all comes down to the money
I'm in it
I'm in it for the cash
I'm in it for the cash
It all comes down to the money
Whether it's rainy or snowy or sunny
Funny, but it all comes down to the money
I'm in it
I'm in it for the cash
I'm in it for the cash

The more you get
The more you want
The more you get, get
Yet the more you want
The more you get
The more you want

It all comes down to money
It all comes down to money

People always kickin' say no to drugs'
But yo, the flow of drugs into the hood makes me bug
I could make a million sellin' flesh to folks
But sellin' flesh to folks is just a hooker, let me quote
See, you can lose your loot on the celo set
'Cause on the celo set a lot of slippin' into debt
See, I could talk for days about friends of mine
And how friends of mine and other people fall behind
A lot of these preachers on your TV set
Are on your TV set to take your loot, then jet
But how to get ahead is real simple, though
It's kinda simple, though, here's the truth, yo

It all comes down to the money
Whether it's rainy or snowy or sunny
Funny, but it all comes down to the money
I'm in it
I'm in it for the cash
I'm in it for the cash
It all comes down to the money
Whether it's rainy or snowy or sunny
Funny, but it all comes down to the money
I'm in it
I'm in it for the cash
I'm in it for the cash

It all comes down to money
It all comes down to money
And it all comes down to money
It all comes down to money
What you're gonna do?
What you're gonna do?
Oh, what you're gonna do?
What you're gonna do, oh yeah
It all comes down to money
It all comes down to money
And it all comes down to money
It all comes down to money
What you're gonna do?
What you're gonna do?
Oh yeah, what you gonna do?
What you're gonna do, oh yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeeeah
What you're gonna do?
What you're gonna do?
Oh yeah
You're gonna make me love somebody else
What you're gonna do?
Oh yeah
You're gonna...Embed
