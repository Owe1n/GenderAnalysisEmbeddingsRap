Kids From The Terror Lyrics {x4}
Can I get a OOOOH and a AAAAH
"Kids from the terror"
OOOOH AAAAH

Explosion, brain, mayhem, terror
Say what, doubt yo, beef kid? Whatever
Jawbones mean nothing to me I break black
I count foes on hands and toes now go stay back
Pythons hooked up to arms keep me calm
Cause I can go way way back to drop the bombs
Screaming
(Oooh and aaah)
Hollering
(Oooh and aaah)
Kids place your bets, throwing bones on the block
I see your .45 yo and I'mma raise you a Glock
Keep them Glock, zu ops, tecs and nine out the rhymes
Punks throw dick beaters like this motherfucker  time
 on the Punks cause we're all about hardcore
Never knocking or ringing so we'll bum rush ya door
Hmm, you're getting mad you'll need more than a miracle
 sound less than physical
Peep hysteria, I bet you feel inferior
But you bring on this noise and who do you got standing up?
Sounds of blackness 
I'm going all out so make way for your death


Feet don't fail me now
I'mma pray for your stomping, the kids for the terror
Fuck up shop, the heat is up, fall off? Never
Got a (Philly) for the (blunt)
Tot a (forty) like a (gun)
You're not big enough to  so (you better run)
Checking and stomping 
Half the reason why the niggas  and died
You try to be roughneck, that's what it must be
Yo Trey,  don't touch me

Alriiiiiiight
Okaaaaay
Alriiiiiiight
Here it comes the mother f'in wrecking, body breaking Punk
After the kids split, the fragments  nigga
Who can pack 
 I got the joints I break off with my crew
I flips the script when I starts to strip
Gotta catch my drift so ah
Lace the hit
To rip I be ripping up crews and you will bruise
And you will see me on the news, sipping on brews
Rrrrrrr
Barbarians, word is bond
