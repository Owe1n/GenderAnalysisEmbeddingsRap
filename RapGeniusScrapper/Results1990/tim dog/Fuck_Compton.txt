Fuck Compton Lyrics
Aw shit, motherfuckers, step to the rear and cheer
'Cause Tim Dog is here
Let's get right down to the nitty-gritty
And talk about a bullshit city
Talkin' about niggas from Compton
They're no comp and they truly ain't stomping
Tim Dog, a Black man's task
I'm so bad I'll whip Superman's ass
All you suckers that riff on the West Coast
I'll diss and spray your ass like a roach
You think you're cool with your curls and your shades
I'll roll thick and you'll be yellin' out, "Raid"
A hard brother that lives in New York
Where suckers are hard and we don't have to talk
Shut your mouth 'fore we come out stompin'
Hey, yo Eazy!, fuck Compton
Fuck Compton
Fuck Compton (Yeah)
Fuck Compton (Oh, yeah)
Fuck 'em

Why you dissing Eazy? 'Cause the boy ain't shit
Chew him with tobacco, and spit him in shit
I'll crush Ice Cube, I'm cool with Ice-T
But N.W.A ain't shit to me
Dre, beatin' on Dee from "Pump it Up!"?
Step to the Dog and get fucked up
I'm simplistic, imperialistic, idealistic
And I'm kicking the ballistics
Having that gang war
We wanna know what you're fighting for
Fighting over colors?
All that gang shit's for dumb motherfuckers
But you go on thinking you're hard
Come to New York and we'll see who gets robbed
Take your jheri curl, take your black hats
Take your wack lyrics and your bullshit tracks
Now you're mad and you're thinking about stomping
Well, I'm from the South Bronx, fuck Compton
You might also like
Fuck Compton (Yeah)
Fuck Compton (Yeah, haha)
Fuck Compton
Fuck 'em

Yo, it's about time we got somebody from the South Bronx
Speakin' on them wack-ass rappers from Compton (Yeah)
Know what, man? They really ain't shit

Tim Dog and I'm the best from the East
And all this Compton shit must cease
So keep your eyes on the prize
And don't jeopardize my wife 'cause that's not wise
You really think that you can rhyme?
Well come and get some of this loaded TEC-9
Buck-buck-buck! Shots are cold gunning
And you'll really be a hundred miles and running
You wanna play? Go ride in a sleigh
I'm so large I fucked Michel'le
In the bathroom we was bonin'
You shoulda heard how the bitch was moanin'
Do, do, boo-do, doo-doo
Do, do, do-do, do, do
Shut the fuck up bitch, you can't sing
You sound like a kid playing on a swing (Fuck you!)
I'm the man at hand to run the band that's in command
You know who the fuck I am
Tim Dog, what's my motherfucking name?
Tim Dog, that's my motherfucking game
So whether you think that I'm just a myth
The riff, the lift, the gift, the if, the fifth
The shift, the spliff, that's in control to hold
To fold, to bold and make an ache and take and fake
Woo, and I'm still too great
Fuck Compton
Fuck Compton (Yeah)
Fuck Compton
Yeah, this a little somethin' to let you know
That these West Coast rappers ain't takin' over
'Cause I'ma say out the South Bronx
And we ain't havin' that shit
Tim Dog, peace out
Fuck 'em6Embed
