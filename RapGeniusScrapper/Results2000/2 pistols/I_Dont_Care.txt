I Don’t Care Lyrics
(Watch the smoke from my cigarette)
It's blood money, baby, 2 Pistols
(Baby, baby, baby)
All California shit (Yah)
No cigarette (2 Chainz!)
(Slowly rise to the ceiling)
Please, no cigarette, I'm ready (Tru)
(I don't care)

If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Look, boy, you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Boy, look, you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)
Uh, just vibin' to myself, mane
Swisher Sweet full, blowin' on that great dane
Big dog shit, your bitch call me Max Payne
2 Pistols, get it? Anyways
I just landed on the West for a few days
I'm on that 405, roof gone, switchin' lanes
My California peach, she likes to roleplay
Lights, camera, action, do your thang
And when she do it, do it—do it, I can't complain—'plain
Pussy, ass, mouth—mouth, that's a triple play
"You a nasty nigga," That's what them hoes say
I reply one thing—

(I don't care)
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Look, boy, you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Boy, look, you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout (Yah)
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)  (2 Chainz!)

Left the supermarket (Yah), took the coupe and parked it (Yah)
You can catch me frequently at Gucci shoe department (Tru)
I tell 'em, "Give me these in all colors" (Colors)
And ain't shit changed, these all hunnids (Tell 'em)
True to my religion, promethazine my prescription (Uh)
I look in the mirror, that's my competition
Then I talk to myself, myself said, "What?" (What?)
I said "You a ill nigga, roll a blunt up" (Damn)
I do it for my hood, south side, A-town
All my dawgs movin' like Greyhounds, we paid for it
Grey car with black wheels, it's lookin' like a skateboard
I've been gettin' money since day one, uh
You might also like
(I don't care)
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Look, boy, you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Boy, look, you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)

—About nothin' but them Benjamins
26 inches lookin' like some ceilin' fans (Chop, chop)
Down the block, candy apple red (Red)
With my Ruger that'll shoot you like Simon said
This rap shit a blessin', I could've gone Fed (Free)
Butter man 'cause pat ballin' stuffed ed
Just ask about me, you coulda got them packets off me
Too many snitches in the street, so I'm rappin' sorry
New Ferrari—'rari, Scaglietti, bitch
You pussy niggas funny—funny, Eddie Griffin shit
I'm with my white chick, nah she ain't super thick
Just call her Abby Wambach, her head game full attack

(I don't care)
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Look, boy, you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)
If it ain't money, money you talkin' 'bout
Boy, look, you can talk your ass off (I don't care)
If it ain't pussy, pussy you talkin' 'bout
Shawty, you can get the fuckin' walk (I don't care)
Yeah, it gotta make sense, man
If it don't make dollars, it don't make cents, man
I'm talkin' 'bout stacks, man, racks, man, haha
Yeah, just let me get fifty 20s, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Twenty 50s, haha, ten hundreds, stacks, man
Gotta make money, man
If it don't make money, man, I don't wanna talk about it
Shawty, if you ain't fuckin', I don't wanna talk neither, haha
It's Blood Money, baby, 2 Pistols
(I don't care)1Embed
