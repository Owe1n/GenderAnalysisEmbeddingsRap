Know That Lyrics
Bolo
It's Blood Money, baby
Yeah
You know how I love money
2 Pistols
Uh, Montana

Call him Mr. Never-Get-Your-Ho-Back, hunnid grands, I throw that (Yeah)
Ne—never get your ho back, hun—hun—hunnid grands, I throw that (Huh?)
Never get your ho back, hunnid grands, I throw that (Huh?)
Ne—never get your ho back, hun—hun—hunnid grands, I throw that (Throw that), throw that
(Throw that) Throw that, ne—ne—never forget your homie
Throw that, throw that, got the streets, you know that
Throw that (Throw that), throw that (Throw that), ne—ne—never forget your homie
Throw that, throw that, got the streets, you know that
You know how I love money
Coke boy before rap, it’s Blood Money, but you know that
Better cuff your ho 'cause I'll snatch her, bro, and have her suckin' dick in that Maybach
They were hatin' on me, this payback, keep that thang on me, stay strapped
Throw—throw—throwin' money, ten racks, your ho fuckin', A—ASAP, uh—uh—uh
My swisher loud, nigga, I can’t hear a thing—thing
I like that pussy bald like Mr. Clean—Clean
My cup muddy, boy, I’m on that fuckin' lean—lean
2 Pistols, but what’s my nickname?

Call him Mr. Never-Get-Your-Ho-Back (Huh?), hunnid grands, I throw that
Ne—never get your ho back (Huh?), hun—hun—hunnid grands, I throw that
Never get your ho back, hunnid grands, I throw that
Ne—never get your ho back, hun—hun—hunnid grands, I throw that (Throw that), throw that
(Throw that) Throw that, ne—ne—never forget your homie
Throw that, throw that, got the streets, you know that
Throw that, throw that, ne—ne—never forget your homie
Throw that, throw that, got the streets, you know that
Coke Boy, baby

Thousand Chain French, she call that, want my flow back
Bullets hit you, call him Mr. Never-Get-Your-Ho-Back
Fuck that beef, cook steak up, all that grind, got to cake up
Get so high, might never wake up, put it in a pot, bread to break up
Got the streets you know that, that respect, you owe that
Pay and fold, better hold, 'cause my niggas grow that
Foot on niggas neck, servin' niggas coke
Pearls iced out, like you seen 'em with the Pope
You might also like
Call him Mr. Never-Get-Your-Ho-Back (Huh?), hunnid grands, I throw that
Ne—never get your ho back (Huh?), hun—hun—hunnid grands, I throw that
Never get your ho back, hunnid grands, I throw that
Ne—never get your ho back, hun—hun—hunnid grands, I throw that, throw that
Throw that, ne—ne—never forget your homie
Throw that, throw that, got the streets, you know that
Throw that, throw that, ne—ne—never forget your homie
Throw that, throw that, got the streets, you know that

Man, your ho wanna suck a nigga, man, your ho wanna fuck a nigga
I hit it then I quit it, hasta la vista, Arnold Schwarzenegger
Semi-automatic, both pistols, I ball, you a broke nigga
Winter time, chinchilla, wipe me down, I’m a pimp nigga, uh—uh—uh
Rollie on my arm cost a whole brick—brick
I chucked a whole bomb, then I scoop your bitch—bitch
You thought that she was at work, she was on my dick—dick
2 Pistols, but what’s my nickname is?

Call him Mr. Never-Get-Your-Ho-Back (Huh?), hunnid grands, I throw that
Ne—never get your ho back (Huh?), hun—hun—hunnid grands, I throw that
Never get your ho back, hunnid grands, I throw that
Ne—never get your ho back, hun—hun—hunnid grands, I throw that, throw that
Throw that, ne—ne—never forget your homie
Throw that, throw that, got the streets, you know that
Throw that, throw that, ne—ne—never forget your homie
Throw that, throw that, got the streets, you know that2Embed
