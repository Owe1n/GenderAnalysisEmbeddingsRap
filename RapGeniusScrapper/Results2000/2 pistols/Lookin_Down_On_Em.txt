Lookin Down On Em Lyrics
Blood Money Union, baby, you already what it is
I'm so fresh, so fly
Young boss of the city, 2 Pistols, baby
Bolo!
Haha, yeah, young boss of the city, nigga
BMU (Deca's in the buildin'), Dec', Cebo (Ayy)
J Flame (Jizzy), Young Skee (Yeah)

I got the Chevy sittin' right (Ayy), rims shinin' bright (Ayy)
(Bitch, I'm—bitch, I'm super fly) When I pull up to that light
I'm lookin' down on 'em (Ayy, ayy)
I'm lookin' down on 'em (Ayy, ayy)
(Wet—wet paint drippin') Off the side (Ayy), every time I ride (Ayy)
I be ridin' through the city, drivin' like I'm Michael Myers
I'm lookin' down on 'em (Ayy, ayy, Dec—Deca's in the buildin')
I'm lookin' down on 'em (Ayy, ayy, Deca's in the buildin')
I just lit a blunt of dro, where the bottom? I don't know (Uhh)
I just float above these suckers and my nickname UFO (Ah)
Got a super-duper flow, arms shootin' for the sky
Steady chokin' on that killer, I just murdered Micheal Myers (Yeah)
Ridin' past the city lights, I maneuver through the night
Movin' colors, I got green and I got purp' (2P got white) (Ayy, ayy)
BMU, bitch, get it right, you got nothin' but you to blame (Haha)
No attention for you lames, I got money on my brain, haha (Got 'em)

Flashin' in lane (Ayy)
Sit so high, bitch, they compare me to a crane (Yuh)
Donk so wet, got dolphins jumpin' out the paint (Okay)
To ride with me, dog, you better buy a scuba tank (Yuh)
The chrome is so strong (Ayy), pray the sun don't shine (Okay)
If it creep through them clouds, some niggas gon' be blind (Ugh)
All I need is UV rays to put them hoes in a daze (Yeah)
Flippin' different flavors, bitch should just call me Lay's (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Cebo, dog, ayy

I got the Chevy sittin' right (Ayy), rims shinin' bright (Ayy)
(Bitch, I'm—bitch, I'm super fly) When I pull up to that light
I'm lookin' down on 'em (Ayy, ayy)
I'm lookin' down on 'em (Ayy, ayy)
(Wet—wet paint drippin') Off the side (Ayy), every time I ride (Ayy)
I be ridin' through the city, drivin' like I'm Michael Myers
I'm lookin' down on 'em (Ayy, ayy)
I'm lookin' down on 'em (Ayy, ayy, Geah)

I pull up to the light (Light), you know I'm ridin' old school (School)
Them main four's lookin' down, nigga, where ya ruler? (So high)
Twenty-eight inch deep-dish (Yes)
Orange candy paint, baby, call it Sunkist (Young boss)
Who me? I'm just that nigga
She wanna ride with the boss 'cause my rims is bigger (Oh yeah)
If I don't look down, I won't even see you niggas
(Where they at? I don't know) I don't even see you niggas
I'm with a bad bitch fornicatin'
With her two friends, and they participatin'
Yeah (Both ways), that's just the life I live
Young boss of the city, baby, it is what it is

I'm gettin' money so, that's the word man
I was fly with the white like Birdman (Yo, yo, brr)
Ayy, Khaled, I'm so hood (Hood)
I shoulda been on "I'm So Hood"
Wriggle in the shop, I grip the oak wood
Twenty-six inches, I'm not overstood (Nah)
I'm the man (Man), understand?
Death Before Dishonor, that's the plan
I'm so fly, bitch (What?), I think I grow feathers (Yeah)
My clique's mobbed out (Out), call us the Blues Brothers (Brothers)
I'm sittin' real high (High), them haters might stare (Stare)
I Freddy Kreugered the whip, to give 'em nightmares
Pull up in somethin fly (Fly), call that Buzz Lightyear (Year)
I spit a little game (Game), cover your wife's ears (Ears)
I'm lookin' down on her, call my whip pap smear (Smear)
Nigga, I'm outta this world, like William Shatner

I got the Chevy sittin' right (Ayy), rims shinin' bright (Ayy)
