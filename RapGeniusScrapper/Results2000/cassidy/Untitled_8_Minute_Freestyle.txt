Untitled 8 Minute Freestyle Lyrics
Look bitch, I'm not feeling your shit
Every song that I'm on, I be killing the shit
Your flow wack, I throw packs, still on the bricks
I'm dealing with six figures, niggas still on the strip
No ceiling when I'm wheeling the whip
Like yeah, your bitch ass is trash, but I'm feeling her lips
That slut probably got my nut still on lips
So much ice in my watch I'm not feeling my wrist
Dont care if you clap and you filling them clips
Get a slug in your hat, gat still on your hips
If you a thug in your raps, why you pussy in real life?
A pimp on the mic and buy pussy in real life
Lay my mack down, I ain't tripping
I ain't slipping, I rap now I ain't tricking
I don't care if she pretty hoe, and I got Diddy dough
And I done had every bad bitch in the city, yo
And I learnt it from Biggie, yo
And got the chicks, that's why the shit rolled off one video
And I'mma go platinum off number two
And I'm gonna drop another album when the summer due
What you gonna do? I know how I'll humble you
I ain't gonna rumble you, I'll put a gun to you
Look dog, I'm small, kinda slinky
Thats why I always got my paws on the blinky
And I can brawl like Winky
Radiant Rock, you can't see no flaws on my pinky
And I be stunting coz I pump crack
If you cats wore my chain for a month you'd be hunchbacked
Duke I shoot, the pump make you jump back
I'm in the coupe and the roof where the trunk at
See I'm the truth, man I leave dudes nauseous
I had to prove who was the hardest and who's garbage
Imma make moves regardless
Coz I sound better than them veterans and I'm a new artist
Cass the bomb, ask ya mom
Coz all of the pretty women think Cass a dime
And all of your little sisters think Cass is fine
Coz my rhymes acid and your asinine, bastard
Everybody know Cass can rhyme
Thats not a question, I was born with it, got a blessing
You might also likeI'm the King, everything that I say hot
You shit sad, niggas just mad coz they not
The shit sad niggas just mad coz they flopped
That coz they ain't have no bars when they dropped
I'm on top like 'Fuck you, pay me"
And when I rock my jewels I don't use my A.C
I get it down, get pounds of AZ
And get kilos of the C.O.K.E
No you ain't not me, you an imposter, duke
Getting fucked for your money like a prostitute
I'm the C.A.-crooked letter crooked letter-.I.D.Y
Who you know cook a better pie?
And my birds have em hooked when I let em fly
I get the cheddar rye, I'm a crook I ain't ever lie
And I ain't never shook, niggas look but they never try
Just like in the stores, niggas look but they never buy
I see it, I like it, I get it, it's nothing at all
Coz I be hustling the raw and ducking the law
And I'll be shopping till it's nothing to fuck in the mall
But I ain't flossing or fronting, its nothing to ball
You say you don't love them hoes but cuffing them all
And and they be still fucking me while they fucking with y'all
Yup dog, I'm worth hundreds of thousands
And I'm starving my stomach is growling, I'm home brand
On the strip with the workhorse grinding
Truck, White leather guts, turquoise lining
Watch, White leather band, turquoise diamonds
White T, Evisu's with the turquoise sign in
Nah I can't lie, Hov put me on Evisu
But when I put em on I be looking better than he do
Cats out there who bought a pair like "Me too!"
Threw blue stones in the chain, the ring see through
Oh you play with them things? I'm like "Me too!"
I put a hole in a nigga big enough to see through
But we all gotta go when it's time
Im pro niggas know I can rhyme
I be in the booth with the dro in the air and the dough on my mind
I'mma blow, niggas know I'm the bomb
I'm, the best that ever did it, the best that gon' do it
The rest ain't ever live it, the rest ain't gon' through it
I was born to do it, I spit like I'm on fluid
I wish that I'd get dissed just to respond to it
And every chick I hit be going through it
I don't know if my girls going wild or going stupid
My bars better that yours,and I'm gon' prove it
And put pressure on every nigga doing music
Coz I been doing this for way too long
The pay too short, and the days to long
That's why I'm, acting a fool, packing a tool
Back to the dude I was before the black and the Jews
Im, slinging the drugs, slinging the drugs
Hanging with thugs I knew before the fame and the love
I'm one of the first artists, who get love from the younguns
And the ones that was in it when it first started
Coz I do it with skill, I ain't just rapping
It'd really happen I do it for real
I move pills and I sold Caine
Cops know me by my whole name
My weed purple like the Soul Plane
And if you don't know, you know now
Its a showdown, on the the low it's gonna go down
Baby, my 3.80, hold 1 in the dome and some of it chrome
Avoid the beef your you running alone
Should have brought your piece your gun is at home
"Thats where you left your gat"?
You'd be dead, trying to run to crib where you left it at
With your chest and your face numb
I'mma keep taking shells out the case till I catch one
Thats dumb, you should have brought your dunn
If you never had a hammer should have bought you one
You gotta take it when you travel
And make it so hot that you could fry bacon on the barrel, Pussy

Nigga swell up so big
That if you live you would probably have stretch marks
? hurt it with pistols
Your bodyguards probably broad, but ain't no murders with you
Thats pathetic, I got a fetish for purchasing pistols
I murder every person thats with you
Rounds from the case running down your legs ain't working, you crippled
Im a crook I put in work, I'm official
In '93 I used to grind tree, now I working with nickels
Times change so the grind change I working sniffles
Do my dirt on the grizzle, focused on the flip
Coke potent, it got the fiends open of the sniff
When they cook it and smoke it they get open off the hit
Shit fresh compressed just broker it off the brick
Blaze lavender haze got you coughing off the joint
Chicks getting emotions getting open off the dick
I'm blowing in the whip and like sui stacks on me
Half a brick of crack with like 6 gats on me
About to dropoff nigga
And I'm flipping weight
So I'm strapped just in case it pop off nigga
I came a long way from knocking nickel rocks off niggas
So for the dough I blow your top off, nigga
And they always knew you'd be a bitch coz your pops soft
Nigga, you're frail or be in jail getting knocked off nigga
The bezel and the band rocked off nigga
So my body temperature rise if I take my watch off nigga
I'm the boy you should cop off nigga
You can smell it through the jar, you ain't gotta take the top off nigga
I stack change, the rap game got it locked off nigga
Enough bitches on my dick, you can hop off nigga
You wouldn't believe how many chicks I popped off nigga
My cock been in more buns than a hot dog nigga
I'm not y'all niggas I ain't snitching or bitching up
I'm a straight cannon don't get it twisted or mix it up
Listen up, there ain't no nigga as ill as me
I'm cocky coz I know niggas feeling me
There're niggas doing life with no possibility of parole
Digging my flows coz ain't no nigga real as me
Thats how it feel to be on top of the world
If a nigga don't like, I'm probably popping his girl
My flow hot and I'm thorough I'm one of kind
And nah, I ain't off my job, none of the time
You write some of the time, I keep coming with rhymes
I spit and make you quit with just one of my lines
But I don't even battle no more
If you ain't got a quarter million bucks, the fuck I'mma battle you for?
If you saw some of the broad and thongs that I been in
You would realize why I'm doing songs for the women
All my songs winning, I'm commercial and all that
With no rehearsal I will still murk you, so fall back
Even if y'all strapped, I can bang with the best of you
Coz I stay at the range, my aim is impeccable
And you the target get all this in the clip
The shells in the .9 Taurus got garlic on the tipsEmbed
