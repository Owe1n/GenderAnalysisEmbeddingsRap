66.6% LyricsI don't believe in God
It ain't hard to fucking tell
Shawty said she a Christian chick
'Til I gave her that dick
Blacker than Satan's shit
Now she call me dark lord
When I'm laying down that pipe
Only call for God
When I come through in the night
Bitch you know I come through
With the fucking shit
Ski mask on my face
On that task force tip
Finna buy a strap
Show you that that shit nice
Pulling on that trigger
Yelling fuck all life
Got that Masamune
Call me Yung Sephiroth
All black fitted with my blade
'Cuz a nigga goth
Bitch I'm looking clean
Rude jeans, know what I mean
Puffing on that blue dream
Hazmat, kush fiend
Never kneel to no idols
No God, too, no bibles
Call me the anti-disciple
Yung Judas, no priest
Got the mark of the beast
Won't catch me on my damn knees
Fuck your god
He's got little niggas hearing me
She ain't praying
But I'll make your girl worship meYou might also likeEmbed
