BIG BOSS Lyrics
In this bitch like I'm Big Boss, aye
In this bitch like who's the boss, aye
Shining so hard I can't stop, aye
Grinding my way to the top

I'm off the shits I can't stop, aye
Bangin' my head like Slipknot, aye
Young nigga dressed like the sauce, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I'm off the shits I can't stop, aye
Bangin' my head like Slipknot, aye
Young nigga dressed like the sauce, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I'm off the shits I can't stop, aye
Bangin' my head like Slipknot, aye
Young nigga dressed like the sauce, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye

In this bitch like I'm Big Boss, aye
In this bitch like who's the boss, aye

Grinding my way to the top, aye
Yo bitch she all on my cock, aye
She like the way that I walk, aye
Got the Glock-9 with the silencer.. Aye!
Pussy boy you better run, aye

Come through and stab in they necks, aye
Fuck with me you gone be next, aye
Yo team they gone end up dead, aye
Nigga you heard what I said, aye
Guillotine off with yo head, aye

Waste my fuckin' time then you got me fucked up, aye
Hungry for them bands imma get my money up, aye
Young wild nigga don't give a fuck and i'm shaking my dreads like it's knuck if you buck
If a nigga got a problem imma pull up and I came solo I don't need no backup, yuh

I'm off the shits I can't stop, aye
Bangin' my head like Slipknot, aye
Young nigga dressed like the sauce, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye

Young nigga dressed like the sauce, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye

I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I'm off the shits I can't stop, aye
Bangin' my head like Slipknot, aye
Young nigga dressed like the sauce, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye

Niggas hating on me and I tell em' suck my dick, aye
I don't give a fuck and I never gave a shit, aye
I just live my life while they whining like a bitch, aye
Stop wasting time when you can live like this, aye
If you bumping this bitch then kick in the door
Y'all know we ain't playing games anymore
Niggas hating on me but they still broke
Niggas gossip on me like they some hoes
Catch a nigga make his back hit the floor and I came through guns out like The Crow
Charge up 'cause i'm high off the dope
Going supersonic all you niggas to slow, yuh


I'm off the shits I can't stop, aye
Bangin' my head like Slipknot, aye
Young nigga dressed like the sauce, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I'm off the shits I can't stop, aye
Bangin' my head like Slipknot, aye
Young nigga dressed like the sauce, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I'm off the shits I can't stop, aye
Bangin' my head like Slipknot, aye
I just feel like I'm Big Boss, aye
I just feel like I'm Big BossEmbed
