HIGH SCORE Lyrics
“You really scared me, if that's what you wanted. Is that what you wanted?”
“No.”
“What do you want?”
“Your blood, all over me.”

Game time lil’ hoe I need that high score
I need them big numbas baby and I need mo’
I’m ‘bout to show these niggas some shit they never seen before
I’m ‘bout to show these niggas some shit they never seen before
Game time lil’ hoe I need that high score
I need them big numbas baby and I need mo’
I’m ‘bout to show these niggas some shit they never seen before
I’m ‘bout to show these niggas some shit they never seen before
Fuck security bitch I’m kicking through the back door
Fuck the moshpit I let the bodies hit the fucking floor
They can't take me down like a bull up at the rodeo
Getting bucked I send ‘em flyin’ and they be like “there he go”
It’s a young crime boss I know all y’all hate me
I do this shit with no effort don’t even try to play me
Young negro flexing through gang baby
Got a bad ho with me looking like Stacy
Ok fuck blue lives nigga my bitch skinny
Pussy taste like honey so I call a ho Winnie
Hit a nigga quick with a wand like Timmy
Make a nigga brain blast quick like Jimmy
Clown ass nigga bitch I’m laughing in yo’ damn face
Had to come around put these nigga in they damn place
Be the top  fast nigga at the drag race
Feel like Big Shaq ask these niggas how my ass taste

Bitch it’s one for the money, two for the show
Three slaps to the face for these niggas they some hoes
How much shit can I take before a nigga finally blow
I’ma make the Earth quake I’ma let the shit go
Bitch it’s one for the money, two for the show
Three slaps to the face for these niggas they some hoes
How much shit can I take before a nigga finally blow
I’ma make the Earth quake I’ma let the shit go
Bitch it’s one for the money, two for the show
Three slaps to the face for these niggas they some hoes
How much shit can I take before a nigga finally blow
I’ma make the Earth quake I’ma let the shit go (hey)
