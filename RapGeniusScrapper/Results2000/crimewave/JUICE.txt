JUICE! Lyrics
(laughter)
Uhh damn (bitch I'm that nigga, you know what the fuck it is, young Crimewave in this baby)
Ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy

Slide a hold and make him , no mask so he know who did it
Nigga tryna press 'em charges he know who's gon' get acquitted
Shout out Johnnie Cochran, bitch I feel like juice, run it back run it back
Bitch, talking shit you might lose a tooth
I'm up in your shows, bitch I'm coolin' I'm like "what it do?"
All these niggas hoes and they  I'm like tell the truth
Imma get my ass out this bitch
I don't need these people
Where I get that check?
Catch me pissin' off the space needle
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat my dick
Lil' shawty tryna suck my shit
We were out the whip
I can whip all that fuckin' shit
Bitch I'm celibate
But with a gun countin' racks and you know I'm selling 

I got the JUICE JUICE JUICE
I got the JUICE JUICE JUICE
Ayy yung nigga got the juice
Ayy yung nigga got the juice
Ayy yung nigga got the juice
Ayy yung nigga got the juice

It's OJ time. Juice? Just toss the gun. Now, do the OJ! Go home and kill your ex-wife. Stab them to death. Make sure to use a glove that doesn't fit!You might also likeEmbed
