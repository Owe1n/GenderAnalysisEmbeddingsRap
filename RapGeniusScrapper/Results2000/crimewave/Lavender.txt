Lavender LyricsNigga I can't hear you while I'm smoking on this fucking purp
Finna call your girl smoke her out make that pussy hurt
Now she all on me and she rolling up my fucking purp
If we throwing hands, I'll leave you dead in the dirt
Yeah we in the function, and we hitting licks
I ain't talking money, I'm just talking chicks
And we steady chilling, cause you know it's lit
High as fuck, eyes red, facing blunts it ain't shit
BHO up in the wrap, straight to the dome, nigga I'm feeling like god
Got that damn blueberry kush, show me your weed, nigga the fuck do you got
Shit looking like it's some mids, look like that reggie, get the fuck out of my sight
Only smoke that loud we ain't smoking weak shit tonight
Yeah I'm smoking loud, and you smoking grass
And you stay jealous, cause I got that gas
Yeah I'm smoking loud, and you smoking grass
You gon' hit a lick on me nigga I'll beat your ass
Nigga I can't hear you while I'm smoking on this fucking purp
Finna call your girl smoke her out make that pussy hurt
Now she all on me and she rolling up my fucking purp
If we throwing hands, I'll leave you dead in the dirt
Nigga you even smoke, you finna choke, you gonna quit on this blunt
We finna smoke a damn half, not double that, yeah ho we do this for fun
Ten in the blunt it ain't nothing, we keep on stunting, nigga I ain't even high
Dipping blunts in the fucking lean now I'm super fried
Call me Jim Jones cause I fly high
With the damn plug cause he's my guy
If you need kush I can get that
Give me that cash for this loud pack
Pushing that weight like I sell crack
Call me Viper cause I'm on that
Y'all fucking cowards don't know about these fucking stacks
Yeah I'm smoking loud, and you smoking grass
And you stay jealous, cause I got that gas
Yeah I'm smoking loud, and you smoking grass
You gon' hit a lick on me nigga I'll beat your assYou might also likeEmbed
