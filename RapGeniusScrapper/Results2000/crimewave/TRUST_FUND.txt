TRUST FUND Lyrics
Ugh
My stepmom's such a fucking bitch
She can't fucking do that
Damnit
Yeah, she can't do that
I wish I was never fuckin' born
She just doesn't understand, man
She just doesn't understand us!
Gets on my fuckin' nerves
Took my Slipknot CDs
We got so much money, bruh
We got all this cash
Ay, ay, all this money, bitch, I think I'm Clyde Cash
You don't get no pussy, you gotta pay for that
My dad own a dealership, I do what I want
Doin' donuts and I'm poppin' off my dad's gun
Three DUIs, bitch you know I beat the case
With a tan preppy bitch and she give me face (yes)
Aeropostale on (yes)
I got three phones (yes)
My dad let me fuck hoes when he ain't at home
My stepmom a bitch, tryna take my midpack
Got the deals on, payin' fourty for the dub sack
Told that bitch 'get up out my room, or you gettin' slapped'
Then I told her 

Yeah, yeah, okay
Made my parents proud so I'm dippin' in my trust fund
Catch me smokin' weed, drunk in my moccasins
Popped polo sayin' YOLO in my cardigan
I'm 'bout to ball out quick 'cause I'm a trust fund kid
Steal my dad's gun, show it to the darked-out kids
'Cause I'm the plug, yuh, got what you need my brother
Got the best dances, I keep that diesel with me
I got some peepers for second cousins, it isn't creepy
They call me Ronald Reagan, they call me Clyde Cash
I got clout with all of these blacks, they got my back
I'm freakin' OJ Simpson, the way I white privilege
Swear I got the cops on call if you try to lift a finger
Swear I got the peanut butter crunch, backwood cuts
I could probably get in the Crips without a fuss
Hit a  so we can fill it up
I ain't actin' like that 'cause I paid for the blunt
You might also like
Spent my whole trust fund cashin' out at 
My dad said he got no son, so you know I'm on the run
Sleepin' on Jack's floor 'cause we had a fallin' out
But I stole his credit card, so you know I'm wildin' out

Don't ask me if I have drugs, what the fuck, dad?
I'm gonna do what I want with a moustache
I been poppin' addy, don't even have fun anymore
Been the house and that means I'm drivin' drunk, yuh

Got my trust fund, and my white tee
Got my trust fund, and my white tee
Got my trust fund, and my white tee
Got my black best friend right beside me
Got my trust fund, and my white tee (yuh)
Got my trust fund (trust fund), and my white tee (yuh)
Got my trust fund
And my white tee
Got my black best friend right beside me
I don't even know how you can think that shit, man
I don't know where the fuck your head's at
I got black friends, man
And they'd ride for me, they'd fuckin' die for me
And I would die for them - y'know what I'm sayin'Embed
