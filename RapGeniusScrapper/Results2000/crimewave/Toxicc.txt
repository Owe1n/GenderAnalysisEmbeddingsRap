Toxicc Lyrics
I'm about to let them have it
Choppa set to automatic
Had to shock them one time
Cause I love causing static
I'm an addict to destruction
Looking like gun fanatic

Nigga back at it
Causing havoc
Cause my swag on problematic
I'm about to let them have it
Choppa set to automatic
Had to shock them one time
Cause I love causing static
I'm an addict to destruction
Looking like a gun fanatic
Why they whine, like some hoes
Acting oh, so dramatic
Let it blow
Let it go
Coming through so traumatic
Still pissed at the world
But I still feel ecstatic
Got the code, to the game
Bitch I got the schematics

Don't give a fuck what a fuck nigga say
Lil ass nigga don't lift no weights
Step to a nigga then you meet your fate
Better pull up to time to waste
No mask on won't catch my case
Thang on my waist I'm bout to let it spray
So how many bullets can you take to the face?
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8

Open the door
Get on the floor
Got 'em all watching I give 'em a show
Got 'em all watching I give 'em a show
Crying and screaming I give 'em some more

4x
All these lame ass niggas better hop off my dick
Bitch I'll never give a fuck
And I'll never give a shit
4x
Bitch I do what I want
And I say what I please
If a nigga got a problem
Bring a nigga to his knees6Embed
