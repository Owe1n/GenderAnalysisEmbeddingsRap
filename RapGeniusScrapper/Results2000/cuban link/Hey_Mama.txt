Hey Mama LyricsHey mama sorry for the things that i have done
You will always be my number one
Im sorry (OoOhhh yeah)
Hey mama you will always be my shining star
Held me tight when i was in your arms
Im sorry (mami im sorry OoOoOoOoOhhhhhh yeah)
Madre querida se que te rompi el corazon
Vine a perdirte el perdon (ay mami OoOoOoOoOhhhhhh yea)
Tu eres mi vida porque es que yo canto esta cancion
Vine a pedirte el perdon (ay mami....mami perdona me)
Perdon madre mia
Mami im sorry i know i probably broke your heart im just like papi
I hope this apology hears your stars like miaki
You stood by me right from the start
I love you mami from your son youll always be my shining star
Made me proud to be part of a family thanx ma
You never lied to me or tried to be somebody your not
You told me how to be a proper g just like grandpa
And always told me to be tough in a problem you can't solve
Never abanded me always sang me to sleep with sweet La-La byes
Ma i apalagize i swear it on my fathers eyes
Make up for all the lies overgrow old and wise
Lifes to short as young as i am i can't afford to die
Is all nice so i praise god you still alive 65 still giving your grandson piggy rides
I wonder why when i was young i wanted guns and knifes
Puffin blunts getting high just hangin with the guys
Tyme flys just like back to the future
Watchin my son now is another reason why i salut you a trooper
A super women from Cuba
Good in cooking,shyt my moms las reina de las tuffas no hay escusas
The truth is that i went to far cause if not i wouldent have been behind bars locked up sleeping on cots
Never forgot you an pop's bailed me out on the spot
Soon as i got home my mom started landing the knot's
That meant you love me a lot i made you suffer a lot
Inside you hurting but outside you looking tough as a rock
Up in the bronx growing up in the profess of blocks
Where you can't trust nobody an the buses dont stop
We lived the hard-knock life far from nice mom was right
Pops would take the better last doller on the cock fights
Thanx to christ i rock mickes for a lunch prize
Tryna do was right paying you back for what you sacraficed
(Chorus)
Hey mama sorry for the things that i have done (you will always be)
You will always be my number one im sorry OoOoOoOoOhhhhhh yeah (yeah uh huh)
Hey mama (hey mama) (c'mon) you will always be my shining star (you will always be my shining star) yea for you i sing this song
Held me tight when i was in your arms (yea)
Im sorry,mami im sorry
Yea perdon madre mia....
(Talking)
Mami i love you, you know that just sometimes is hard to express it
The life i live the life i chose
So im here to express my real feelings you know i love you now an forever
Till death do us part youll always be my heart
Madre querida yo se que te rompi el corazon
Vine a pedirte el perdon (ay mami OoOoOoOoOhhhhhh yea)
Tu eres mi vida porque es que yo canto esta canccion
Vine a pedirte el perdon (ay mami)
