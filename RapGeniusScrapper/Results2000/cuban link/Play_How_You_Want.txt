Play How You Want Lyrics
Oh oh
Yeah yeah
Are you ready for P!nk and Cuban Link?
Are you ready?
Oh oh

It's P!nk and Cuban Link
This is the club with a latin swing
So if you wit' it baby
Blaze up a blunt
Drink till your drunk
Ain't no rules where we're from
Do your thing, play how you want
They call him Cuban Link
Cause he be shinin' like a diamond ring
Now we be bringin' it straight from the Bronx
Drinkin' Dom Pérignon
Till six in the mornin' there's a party goin' on

Yeah, yo
Mommas be lickin' their lips
Lookin' as if they wanna give me a kiss
Shakin' their hips
I'm so good that they be givin' me tips
Is it perhaps that they think I'm really handsome and shit?
Or just the fact that I'm latin
And I'm packin' the dick
No matter what it is, I'm wit' it
Don't be actin' shy or timid
If you want it I'mma give it
No gimmicks, and sky's the limit
Baby, don't stop, get it, get it
Pump that pussy, let me hit it
If you wit' it, admit it
I don't talk it, I live it
Give it a minute and I'm already half way there
There's isn't still not a player
With your ass in the air
Takin' your underwear's off
Cause I just don't care
Dead in the middle of the dance floor
Naked, oh yeah
Take it and get it
Cause the rhythm got you shakin' your rear
You got a glare
Like you haven't been fucked in a year
Touchin' your hair
While I whisper sweet nothings in your ear
Love champagne but I'd just rather
Guzzle a beer
Come over here, honey
Cause you ain't got nothing to fear
Get something clear
I'm a player, but you can trust me dear
So look it here
If there's a party, Mami, meet me at the pier
We can stay in Manhattan and have a passionate affair
Yeah, yeah

Blaze up a blunt
Drink till your drunk
Ain't no rules where we're from

Cause he be shinin' like a diamond ring
Now we be bringin' it straight from the Bronx
Drinkin' Dom Pérignon
Till six in the mornin' there's a party goin' on

New York City, where the thugs out
Get the snub tucked under the gut while
I'm in the club, in a tuxedo gettin' buffed out
'Nuff clout, bobbin' up and down
With the rough style of a tough crowd
Guess I'm buck wild
Now it's Uptown in the house
Without a doubt
I'm from the South Bronx
I love it when they put it in their mouth
Make 'em shout
Shake your body, Mami, stick that tongue out
Break it down
Cuban Link is gonna leave you strung out
But no doubt, freak out
We gonna have some fun now
Rock the crowd, bump it loud
From sunrise to sundown
Check the files, I'm a wild dude
Loud buddah, pile drive you like Raul
I betcha I make you do what I do
Besides, boo
People, when they lie, tell the truth
I have you flyin' through the roof
Just come and ride it for the proof
It's Mister Cuban Link, baby
And I'll do my thing, baby
Whether the rappin' or singin
In Spanish, English or Reggae
But baby, baby
Mamita, dame un beso asi
It's all on me
But only if the sex for free
 Papi, where do you want me to kiss you at? On your chest?
 A little lower, baby
 Where on your belly button?
 A lil' on the left. Oh that's what I'm talkin' about!
