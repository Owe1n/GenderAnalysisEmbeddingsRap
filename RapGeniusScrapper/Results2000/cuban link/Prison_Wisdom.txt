Prison Wisdom LyricsMessage to the world you know what I'm saying
Just cause you locked up doesn't mean you invisible
You still exist and your words is felt
So peep and take heat to these thought to a comrade
You know what I'm saying-put it like this:
Yo, many people will walk in and out of your life
But only true friends will leave imprints in your heart
In our short experience that we shared
Imprints was left behind
To handle yourself is to use your head
To handle others is to use your heart
Anger is only one letter short of danger
If somebody betrays you once, it's his fault
If he or she betrays you twice, it's your fault
Great Minds discuss ideas
Average minds discuss events
Small minds discuss people
God gives every bird it's food
But he who's not thrown into his nest
He or she loses money loses much
He or she who loses a friend loses more
He or she who loses faith loses it all
Learn form the mistakes of other
You can't live long enough to make them all yourself
The tongue weighs practically nothing
But so few people can hold it
FRIENDS- you and me we started a bond, a circle, a friendship
And like that circle there is no beginning and there is no end
Only if it is between two true friendsYou might also likeEmbed
