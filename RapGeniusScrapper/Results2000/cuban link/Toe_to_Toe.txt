Toe to Toe Lyrics
Let's go toe to toe
Any stupid ass can blast a foe
And let me know who man enough to go toe to toe
Somebody let me know
Who's not afraid to go blow for blow
And show how real niggas really roll

Yo
Niggas know not to front
I can knock a chump out the box
And just stomp fuck a Glock or pump
So pop the trunk and grab your .38
Ill snap your fucking vertebrae
And match your early date to the pearly gates
My murder rate is phenomenal
What I'mma do
Is crush your abdominals
Save the talk for Donahue
This I promise you
Big Punisher gotta keep it real
A puerto rock gorilla blowin' spots like godzilla
A crowd thrilla' in the rap arena
The Bob Jab and weaver
That keeps niggas on their toes like ballerinas
I"ll bag ya team up in a hundred heftys
If you wanna come and test me
Son forget the guns and knuckle up against me
Ill fuck you up like Dempsey but without the gloves
Spit out the double edge﻿ and wet ya motherfucking mug
Wit blood
Im rough and rugged
I shine like a nugget
Im the last motherfucker that you ever wanna fuck wit
Up it
Or get stuck by the Cuban Link
I do my thing bringing it back and forth like a boomerang
You can't hang
So think again before you start rappin'
We make it happen
Two Latin thugs too tough to flatten

Fuck the clappin' lets get to scrappin'
Grapplin' on the floor
Niggas thinking they hardcore till I lock the door
Figure four!
Break ya ankles
Shank ya face make you scream thank you
Hang you off the roof naked just to make an example
Handle ya business
In this game there ain't too many winners
Any nigga can render your existence if his aim is better
Hold ya fort down whether with or without the four pound
New York down for whatever
What up twin
You might also like
I never back down
I hold my ground and pound a body like Muhammad Ali
Papi we can lock up﻿ in the lobby
I be
Bobbin and weaving leaving niggas out of breath
Then I dig in they chest with my 5 fingers of death
TS bringing it live from the boogie
My crew be too deep
Our biggest pussy will make sushi out chok and suki
So for the rookies who be talking in riddles
How many hits it'll take
Before I break through your middle?

You too little
I'm cock diesel with evil intent
Leave you with dents, bent over fetal, while your people repent
Set it
Lets get it on like Marvin I'm starving to fight
Gem Starring em slice like an orator carve with a knife
Im deadly
Niggas already dread me in every scary area beware of the jaw burier
Big dog's the terrier
Tearing the ears off of artists
That's mostly cartilage
No bullshitting
You rip em right off just pull em hard enough
Rolling with us
You must be ready for death hit you with so many rights
You going beg for a left
Let's go toe to toe
Any stupid ass can blast a foe
And let me know who man enough to go toe to toe
Somebody let me know
Who's not afraid to go blow for blow
And show how real niggas really rollEmbed
