Helluva Life Lyrics
Chyea! Woaah
Wake up ballin' man, go to sleep stuntin' man, woaah
Whole team on this one man, woaah
Ghetto superstars, Gucci, hey, yeeaah!
One hell of a life, one hell of a life
One hell of a life, one hell of a life
I feel ya Gucc! Haah!

I'm livin' one hell of a life
Crazy colored karats, baby cover your eyes
Foreign headlights and I'm smoking a lot
One of those nights in my hell of a life
I brought out all the Ice so I shine like a star
You see me from afar girl you know who I'm are
A ghetto superstar in a hell of a car (It's Gucci nigga)
A ghetto superstar, it's a hell of a life
Ros√© not beer, toast!
Baby say cheers major ice make you go burr
Cake so big its like yeah
Swag so stupid I'm a real tight bear
A bunch of street niggas get off no label
See me on the flat screen now I'm on cable
Able
And it's human nature to hate a
Playa gettin' paper, money like skyscraper
It's Gucci!

I'm livin' one hell of a life
Crazy colored karats, baby cover your eyes
Foreign headlights and I'm smoking a lot
One of those nights in my hell of a life
I brought out all the Ice so I shine like a star
You see me from afar girl you know who I'm are
A ghetto superstar in a hell of a car
A ghetto superstar, it's a hell of a life

Went to sleep in Michigan and woke up in Miami (Where?)
South Beach, sleep with a bitch in my pajamas
Pour the most expensive liquor from the most expensive vase
Smoke the most expensive dro and rock the most expensive clothes
The cars that we ride ain't out this year
I got diamonds on my pinky on my wrist and on my ear
Baby I'm a chandelier standing on the bar like an ice cold beer
We out of here, it's been a hell of a night
You might also like
I'm livin' one hell of a life
Crazy colored karats, baby cover your eyes
Foreign headlights and I'm smoking a lot
One of those nights in my hell of a life
I brought out all the Ice so I shine like a star
You see me from afar girl you know who I'm are
A ghetto superstar in a hell of a car
(Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye)
A ghetto superstar, it's a hell of a life
(Young Juice)

Michael Jackson diamonds
VVS colour
Pull up to the club in a 08 Mustard
Bussin' 50 bricks dog, use a little muscle
Young Juiceman, god damn I'm a hustler
Ghetto superstar and my money super doubled
Prada shoe walking and the rap game troubled
Six go cookin', sold the juice bunkin'
Young Juiceman smokin' pounds of that funky

I'm livin' one hell of a life
Crazy colored karats, baby cover your eyes
Foreign headlights and I'm smoking a lot
One of those nights in my hell of a life
I brought out all the Ice so I shine like a star (Aye, aye, aye, aye)
You see me from afar girl you know who I'm are (Aye, aye, aye, aye)
A ghetto superstar in a hell of a car (Aye, aye, aye, aye)
A ghetto superstar, it's a hell of a life (Aye, aye, aye, aye)
Yeeeahhh...2Embed
