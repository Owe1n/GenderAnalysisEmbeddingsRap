Hood Nigga Lyrics
All the hoes jockin' (Jockin'), beat steady knockin' (Knockin')
Middle of the stage, got the whole club rockin' (Rockin')
Nigga, you can hate, but your bitch steady watchin' (Watchin')
Bet she can't do it on the dick, she poppin' (Poppin')
We bottle poppin', you cock-blockin'
Told ya girl you rap but your CD floppin' (Floppin')
Say you gettin' money, man, we ain't seen nothin' (Nope)
Your girl is persistent, she ain't stoppin'
Man, she say she want a—
(Hood nigga) I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bunkin', y'all know we run the town (Yeah)
(Hood nigga) And I keep a bad bitch around
(Thick bitch) Long hair, yellow, white, red, brown (Yeah)
(Hood nigga) And my Chevy's sit on 24's
Flats look like flapjacks (Pancakes?) You ain't know?
(Hood nigga) I'ma play the game how I know
They can take me out the hood, but I'ma keep it hood, folk

And I don't need a scale for the work
I can eyeball purp, I am not you, jerk (Jerk)
Hatin' on me'll make your situation worse
You don't wanna take a ride in that long, black hearse
All eyes on me, shawty, I'ma bomb first (First)
I'm the truth, and they say the truth hurts
Hustle mean hard work (Hard work?)
If you scared, go to church
Man, this rap shit is easy, every beat I get, I murk
'Cause I'm a—

(Hood nigga) I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bunkin', y'all know we run the town (Yeah)
(Hood nigga) And I keep a bad bitch around
(Thick bitch) Long hair, yellow, white, red, brown (Yeah)
(Hood nigga) And my Chevy's sit on 24's
Flats look like flapjacks (Pancakes?) You ain't know?
(Hood nigga) I'ma play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood, but I'ma keep it hood, folk
You might also like
Get like you? (Nah) Get like me (Me)
Evisu, we don't rock white tees (Tees)
Classic Capris, but Knicks on my feet (Feet)
Camo Bathing Apes, ten pair every week
Menage a three, the girls suck me to sleep (Sleep)
Z-O-E climax to the beat (Beat)
I see you? Nah, you see me
You'll see ICU fuckin' with me, 'cause I'm a—

(Hood nigga) I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bunkin', y'all know we run the town (Yeah)
(Hood nigga) And I keep a bad bitch around
(Thick bitch) Long hair, yellow, white, red, brown (Yeah)
(Hood nigga) And my Chevy's sit on 24's
Flats look like flapjacks (Pancakes?) You ain't know?
(Hood nigga) I'ma play the game how I know
They can take me out the hood, but I'ma keep it hood, folk

(Hood nigga) Watchin' out for "Gold Diggers" like Kanye (Kanye)
But I will pay Beyoncé (Beyoncé)
Or Ashanti (Ashanti), make Keyshia Cole say
She should've cheated if she ever come my way
Get some head from Fantasia on the highway (Highway)
Trickin' off, Magic City every Monday (Monday)
It ain't trickin' if you got it—that's what I say
(You say?) I say, and what I say goes, 'cause I'm a—
(Hood nigga) I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bunkin', y'all know we run the town (Yeah)
(Hood nigga) And I keep a bad bitch around
(Thick bitch) Long hair, yellow, white, red, brown (Yeah)
(Hood nigga) And my Chevy's sit on 24's
Flats look like flapjacks (Pancakes?) You ain't know?
(Hood nigga) I'ma play the game how I know
They can take me out the hood, but I'ma keep it hood, folk

All the hoes jockin' (Jockin'), beat steady knockin' (Knockin')
Middle of the stage, got the whole club rockin' (Rockin')
Nigga, you can hate, but your bitch steady watchin' (Watchin')
Bet she can't do it on the dick, she poppin' (Poppin')
