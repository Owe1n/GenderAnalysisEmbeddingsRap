State of the Union Lyrics
No puedo dormir
Yo veo espíritu
(This ghost in my head, ghost in my head)
Heatmakerz
Crack Music
Capo

I think my critics need to hear this
Or anyone who doubts my political awareness
I'm what you call a democratic with an automatic
A rebel and a bezel when I just ordered the Patek
You could build a wall as tall as the sky (To the moon)
We all know the coke still go far from the sky
Papi had a room with a wall full of pies
This is America, baby, where we fall for the lies (Impeach the president)
We never had much, but we had us (Uh-uh)
And even when the bills didn’t add up
We cooked up coke and it was crills that we bagged up
We sold in broad day and police still didn't bag us
I be ready to kill one of you MAGA's (Fuckers)
Shit, I’m throwin' shots, man, you still throwin' daggers
And my thoughts on the legalization
And they tryna turn weed into a legal libation
Why won't they legalize Haitians? (Sak Pasé?)
And throw on the Cubans too
I told my jeweler he could throw on a Cuban too
Or bust down a Rollie, it's frozen at two to two (West Side)
I took a private jet and you know where I flew the crew (LA)
Them coconut drinks that come with umbrellas in 'em
In the rain, we buy Rolls's that come with umbrellas in 'em (Facts)
The transition, baby, that was the hardest part
Police pulled me over and they still ripped my car apart (Don’t shoot)
So, I ain’t got to kneel just to stand with you (Uh-uh)
I was really in the field with them hand pistols (Facts)
I was really throwin' bullets like the Cap, huh, Cap, huh
(Nigga fuck around and get clapped)
I mean, uh
Shine a light on my feet, Lord, watch my steps
This ghost in my head, ghost in my head
Got the world after me but I can’t look back
This ghost in my head, ghost in my head

Life's so short but the money's so long
Drop-tops in the summertime, mink coats when it's cold
But I’m cold every night (305)
Please Lord, hold me, hold me close (Yes)

Pushin' Phantoms, so they feel I'm preachin' propaganda
Say a prayer for my niggas or we light a candle
All the squares in your circle, time to change the channel
Or unplug the television 'cause this shit is mental (Huh)
My sneakers Chanel, Grim Reaper for real
I get beats from Pharrell, you should see how I live
Kids in Montessori school, logos in the pool
I done put in all my work, no longer holding tools
Look into my eyes, you can see the murders
Smell the kilos on me, now we flippin' burgers
Ride through the ghetto, look for shit to purchase
Do it for the fam, don't forget your purpose
When you sellin' grams, then you just a merchant, nigga
When you sellin' grams, then you just a merchant
Eyes open wide, slither with a serpent (Woo)
Closed casket meaning God, close the curtains (This ghost in my head)
Meaning God, close the curtains (This ghost in my head)
Meaning God, close the curtains (This ghost in my head)
God, close the curtains (Ghost in my head)
Oh Lord

Shine a light on my feet, Lord, watch my steps
This ghost in my head, ghost in my head
Got the world after me but I can't look back
This ghost in my head, ghost in my head

Shine a light on my feet, Lord, watch my steps
Ghost in my head, ghost in my head
Got the world after me but I can't look back
Ghost in my head, ghost in my head2Embed
