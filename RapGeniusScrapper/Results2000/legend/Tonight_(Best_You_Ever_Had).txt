Tonight (Best You Ever Had) Lyrics
Alright

Ain't this what you came for?
Don't you wish you came more?
Girl, what you playin' for?
Ay, come on
Come on let me kiss that
Ooh, I know you miss that
What's wrong? Let me fix that
Twist that
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight, I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

I hit you with the best stroke
Freestyle and then the breaststroke
'Til you're blowin' cigarette smoke
And now the beds broke
So what we gon' do now?
Fuck it, round two now
Work it out, then we cool down
Cool down

Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight, I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be (I don't wanna brag)
(Give me a little bit of that light-skinned love, baby)
The best you ever had

Luda! Listen
You ain't even gotta text me
Knowin' me and you got that mental telepathy
Me be up at the spot, I'll be sendin' over the chauffeur
Rich nigga, bread stay poppin' like a toaster
Nobody, come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella
We'll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm
Sex in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body
Yep, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the Thrilla in Manila
Flyin' my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on a grill
That's 'cause seven days a week youâ€™re my five-course meal for real

Baby, tonight's the night I let you know (Baby, tonight)
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control (Woo! It's gon' be tonight, baby)
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight, I'll be the best you ever had (Be the best you ever had)
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be (I don't wanna brag)
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had30Embed
