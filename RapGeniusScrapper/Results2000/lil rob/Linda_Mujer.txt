Linda Mujer Lyrics
Every time I see you, I just wanna meet you
Say hello, how you doing? What are you doing tonight?
We should hook up tonight, have some fun tonight
Is that alright? I love your smile, you smile so bright
I'll compliment you all night, that's no problem
If you got flaws, I can't spot 'em, you ain't got 'em
From top to bottom, baby, you got it and I want it
Classy, but erotic and modest and honest
One of the finest girls I've ever seen
You and me would be a good thing, you can depend on me
Ven aquí, take a chance on me
I guarantee I'll do whatever it takes to make you feel happy
Just treat me right and I'll be right
The only thing you'll need tonight
And every night I'll tuck you in to make sure you're sleeping tight
Blow out the candle lights and kiss you goodnight
Linda Mujer, tú sabes bien
Que te quiero, baby, you drive me crazy
Such a classy lady
Such a lovely lady
I think I love you, baby
Linda Mujer
Tú sabes bien
Que te quiero
Y por tu amor
Yo sí que muero

I saw you kicking back down the block, you stole my breath
I couldn't talk, couldn't walk, couldn't breathe
Please don't leave, you might be the one I need
Hopefully we'll talk eventually
Do you mention me when you talk to your friends?
Oh, how I hope you do
I wanna get close to you, do notice me?
Notice you, love everything you do
I don't even know you, but I want to
Do you want me? 'Cause I want you
And I'll do what I got to
Every time I dream, it's about you
There's something about you, there's something else
Couldn't see myself with no one else
It's just the little things you do
That really gots me digging you

Que te quiero, baby, you drive me crazy

Such a lovely lady

You're so sophisticated and I hate it, gots me intimidated
I've got things to say and I can't say it
Rather make this slow jam and play it
Dedicate it to you by the man who made it
Let me be your favorite thing
Head of your daily routine
You can tell me how you feel, baby, I'm for real
Believe me, I know what you mean
My love is king, let me crown you with my heart
Think we're wasting time and I think we should start
Well it's getting dark, better let you go
Where do you live and can I get you home?
Do you have a phone I can reach you at?
A favorite place where I can meet you at?
Get together and have a drink or two
And let you know just how much I think of you
Linda Mujer, tú sabes bien
Que te quiero, baby, you drive me crazy
Such a classy lady
Such a lovely lady
I know I love you, baby
Linda Mujer
Tú sabes bien
Que te quiero
Y por tu amor
