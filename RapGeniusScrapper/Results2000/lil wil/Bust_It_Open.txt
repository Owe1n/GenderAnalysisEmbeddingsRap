Bust It Open Lyrics
Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open
Bust that, bust that pussy open

Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
I'm a beast up in these sheets, it's like somethin' you never had (This a Big E beat)
Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open
Bust that, bust that pussy open
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
I'm a beast up in these sheets, it's like somethin' you never had
Drop it down low and bring it back up to my intersection
Wanna feel your intersection penetrate my intersection
Bend over, wiggle it, wobble it, girl, I'm lovin' it
You just keep on doin' your thing and I'ma start dougie-ing
Beat that pussy up like it's some cake mix
Go'n suck a nigga dick, quit all that fake shit
I ain't got no patience, bitch
Been wantin' to beat for 'bout a week
And put this meat up on your teeth
I know you a freak, so let me see
Be everything that you can be
Put this dick so far up in you, baby, you'll be wigglin' knees
I like to toss her with my piece while sippin' drank and smokin' weed
You can pop an ecstasy, we'll take your ass to Ecstasy
One in your mouth, one in your back, tappin' ass like piano keys
One bitch tried to handle me, met her down on Miami Beach
Pussy like a cameltoe, ass shaped like a Georgia peach
Popped me a stamina or an X and bammed on a freak
I don't know what she was thinkin', I know what I wanna see

Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open
Bust that, bust that pussy open
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
I'm a beast up in these sheets, it's like somethin' you never had
You might also like
You really got me wan' touch it, you really got me wan' fuck it
Lil' mama, what it gon' take to get some of that twelve play?
You really got me wan' touch it, you really got me wan' fuck it
Lil' mama, what it gon' take to get some of that twelve play?
Mommy, you lookin' good with your lil' sexy ass
You got a big donkey ass, got a nigga wantin' that
And you better stop doin' that
'Cause the way you shake your ass
Got me wan' drop my pants
Get behind, throw up my hands
Look at the monster in that pussy
No cakin', I beat shit up
Like Plies, if that pussy smell like water, I might eat you up
Yes, ma'am, I'm a freak or somethin', a fiend for a yellow bone
A trick for some super head, in love with them redbones
Keep one on the roof of my home, think I'm just mouthin', huh?
Give a nigga some of that pussy before I take it, ma
Pull your drawers to the side, let me shove my cobra inside
And take your ass on a rollercoaster ride

Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open
Bust that, bust that pussy open
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
I'm a beast up in these sheets, it's like somethin' your never had
I said, oh, baby girl, yes, I'm workin' with that wood
Bust that pussy open 'cause I know you got that good
I said, oh, baby girl, yes, I'm workin' with that wood
Go'n bust that pussy open 'cause I know you got that good, yeah
Fire, fire, fire (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Fire, fire, fire (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Fire, fire (Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Go'n bust that pussy open 'cause I know you got that good, yeah

Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open
Bust that, bust that pussy open
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Bust that, bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
I'm a beast up in these sheets, it's like somethin' you never had1Embed
