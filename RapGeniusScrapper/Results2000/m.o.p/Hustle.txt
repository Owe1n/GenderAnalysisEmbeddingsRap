Hustle Lyrics
Same game, different players yo
Different players, same game yo
Same game, different players yo
But they don't hear me, listen

See I done came from the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle 
From the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle
Fuck a dollar and a dream, all I need is my Llama and a scheme
Some niggas sling their product to the fiends
But I'm in the stinking ass Lincoln like the one in Dead Presidents
Riding with a lean, out for dead presidents
St. Marxmen raised me, it's evident, I been thuggin' ever since
Now I ain't do a bunch of time with mothafuckas up north
But I push guns to the stomachs to them niggas that floss
They say: "that boy Fame bad" got 'em going mad
I don't use that word swag, it ain't in my vocab
To my CBR rider niggas, put it in the air
We don't push Katanas my nigga that's for them squares
I told the church lady put us in her prayers
Illuminati try to put us in the chair
It was a different game when I reminisce
So when a nigga hatin', I just tell him this

See I done came from the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle 
From the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle

I'm a sinner  I'm a sinner
Voted most likely to fail from the beginning
The high stakes, with no faith, and mo expectations to ever fit in with greatness
They see me as amazing in places I can't pronounce now
Forever gracious for that BK bounce now
This factory chrome untinted, en route to an immaculate home nigga, owned not rented
Since i'm in it, then I want it all, ain't no depression here
So yeah you haters will always have a job
I'm different from whatever you envision in the blog
I'm an extension of a traditional nigga going hard
This is Street Certified you don't wanna get involved
My past too deep to be deleted from the log
Don't see me as a rapper, the hood's where I fit
Don't underestimate me dawg, remember this

See I done came from the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle 
From the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle
So when I took through the bottom, no it's not a problem
I'm saluted in every hood, the goons know I got 'em
I ain't the one to stunt but when I do niggas notice
Blow through in that bitch like it's stolen
Back around the block, got one in the slide
All I got is my word, my balls and my pride
Get splashed to the first 48
Worst case scenario, catch me after the first 48
When the heat get hot, I stays in the fold
I rose with them wolves, that ride with them fo's
Collide with you foes and now you surprised at the road
That I chose, to survive and I rose
From casing the dope spot, to paper you can't fold
From beating a black top, to rocking these live shows
I'm Danze, I can never be deprived of this glow
I could tell you, but you already know

See I done came from the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustle 
From the bottom, I can never go back
Try to live my dreams, 'til it fade to black
To me it's all a hustle 
It's all a hustleEmbed
