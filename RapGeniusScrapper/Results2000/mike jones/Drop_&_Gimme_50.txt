Drop & Gimme 50 Lyrics
Ahh (Collipark)
Who? Mike Jones (Drop and gimme fifty)
Who? Mike Jones (Drop and gimme fifty, drop and gimme fifty)
Smurf, you did the fool with this one, baby (Drop and gimme fifty, drop and gimme fifty)
Ayy (Drop and gimme fifty)
I got her, Hurricane Chris (Say girl, say girl)
And right now (Say girl, say girl)
We want all the sexy ladies (Say girl, say girl)
10th Ward Buck, what up? Haha (Drop and gimme fifty)
Drop and gimme fifty, Hurricane, holla at 'em
She bustin' it wide open and shakin' it on the flo'
I'm finna go to the bar to get some drank and hit the flo'
I'm finna get on the flo' (Oh), I'm finna get on the flo' (Oh)
I'm finna get on the flo' (Oh), I'm finna get on the flo', she wanna
Drop and gimme fifty, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, girl, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, girl, drop and gimme fifty (Yeah, Mike Jones)

Lil' mama right there bad, she drop it and shake it fast
Come holla, I got the dollars, got more if ya ass will swallow
She shakin' it by the Rover, poppin' it by the Bentley
She know that I'm high and tipsy, now drop it and gimme fifty
She see me with Hurricane so she drop it and do her thang
But she know when I get inside, I'ma fuck up her walls, mane
She see me with Collipark, she see me with 3 Feet
She know when it come to mine she know it ain't three feet
She bustin' it wide open, and shakin' it on the flo'
She said if I get her tipsy we gon' leave and hit the mo'
I told her, "Girl, here you go," I tease her on the low
Now she freakin' me on the flo', she beggin' me for some mo'
I hit it then hit the do', I hit her just like the dro
Ice Age and 51/50 we in the donk
You might also like
She bustin' it wide open and shakin' it on the flo'
I'm finna go to the bar to get some drank and hit the flo'
I'm finna get on the flo' (Oh), I'm finna get on the flo' (Oh)
I'm finna get on the flo' (Oh), I'm finna get on the flo', she wanna
Drop and gimme fifty, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, girl, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, drop and gimme fifty (Yeah)
Drop and gimme fifty, girl, drop and gimme fifty (Yeah)

Now put your right hand in the air
Put the left one in your underwear
Now tickle that cat, tickle that cat
Now tickle that cat, tickle that cat, ooh
She act a fool on the dick, fool on the dick
She act a fool on the dick, fool on the dick
Now get sick with it, and do the split with it
Now get sick with it, and do the split with it
Say girl, drop and gimme fifty, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, girl, drop and gimme fifty
Now I don't mean to start no riot
All the ugly women in the house be quiet

She bustin' it wide open and shakin' it on the flo'
I'm finna go to the bar to get some drank and hit the flo'
I'm finna get on the flo' (Oh), I'm finna get on the flo' (Oh)
I'm finna get on the flo' (Oh), I'm finna get on the flo', she wanna
Drop and gimme fifty, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, girl, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, girl, drop and gimme fifty (Yeah)
Now by the third verse it's way hotter, we wide open
She dropped it down low with her hips and her thighs rollin'
I noticed that can't nobody do it like I do it
I'm posted in the V.I.P. with two chicks on the side of me
We got money so tell the other niggas to stop pullin' out they cash
And let me see how you act for a stack
Drop it low and bring it up like you a fool
Now put a dip in your back and let me see what you could do
She say if she bend it over it'll be a full moon
I told her to bend it over, let me see that full moon
Like the boom boom room whole club on tune
Shake it like you tryna break it, ain't no sense in even fakin'
You know me, I do it big, buy the bar, and tell 'em gin
Soon as we walk in the do', we go straight to the dance floor and get it poppin'

She bustin' it wide open and shakin' it on the flo'
I'm finna go to the bar to get some drank and hit the flo'
I'm finna get on the flo' (Oh), I'm finna get on the flo' (Oh)
I'm finna get on the flo' (Oh), I'm finna get on the flo', she wanna
Drop and gimme fifty, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, girl, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, girl, drop and gimme fifty (Yeah)
She bustin' it wide open and shakin' it on the flo'
I'm finna go to the bar to get some drank and hit the flo'
I'm finna get on the flo', I'm finna get on the flo'
I'm finna get on the flo', I'm finna get on the flo', she wanna
Drop and gimme fifty, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, girl, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, drop and gimme fifty
Drop and gimme fifty, girl, drop and gimme fifty (Yeah)

This what you get when Collipark hook up with The Package Sto', nigga
Ya'll ain't know we was comin' back like this, did ya?
YeahEmbed
