Isle Unto Thyself Lyrics
Blinding, shining star
You won't see so far
Know what can't be shown
Feel what can't be known

You were an isle unto thyself
You had a heart you hadn't felt
Why would it hurt me?
Or was it real?
It was the night we had to part
We were afraid to miss the start
What did it matter?
Why would it matter?
And could we heal?
Blinding, shining star
You won't see so far
Know what can't be shown
Feel what can't be known

I was a victim of magic, Apollo
Catching my breath as I bled on the ground
Somebody called me to follow, I followed
Thinking aloud without hearing the sound

Then, all the planets fell to dust
Lonely, departing after us
Gone, not forgotten
Long, but forgotten old lore
In every element of life
Love camouflaging under strife
Or other matters
Mind over matters, let there be more

Maybe you'll exit tomorrow, the sorrow
Sweeping you off as your island replies
Sudden invincible flowing a river
Clearer than all thou might view with thine eyes
You might also like
Why did fire-erupted lands arrive?
Why did murderous animals survive?
Why did we deserve to be revived?
Why was any and everything alive?17Embed
