Labyrinth Lyrics
See how I circle
Imaginary mind, imaginary lines
Let the maze of my design carry you on

Just bumped my head and my face turns purple
Running through hurdles, running in circles
Trying to escape from this thing that I fear
Everything seems clear like the end is near
In the rear, I can see the beast getting close
Surrounded by ghosts in a cloud of smoke
The smoke reeks of failure, I don't want to fail
But all the stairwells lead straight to hell
So I'm jumping trap doors in the floor 'fore they floor me
Focus on the love and the light right before me
Walls keep spinning and my path keeps turning
Patience thinning and my calves keep burning
Hotter than a furnace, suddenly I'm learning
Maybe I finally reached the point of no return and
East is North and West is South
I feel like I'ma never get out
I'm trapped
See how I circle
Imaginary mind, imaginary lines
Let the maze of my design carry you on
See how I fly away

Behind me my ex-girl's chasing me
In front of me my next girl's facing me
Awaiting me, the light's in my sight
But I can't cross these enemy lines I'm behind
I can feel the fatigue but I'm dying to shine
But the road winds, I rewind, I rewind
Got to find a new place to hide for the night
Will I ever escape? Boy, I try and I try
Everybody's watching me, I'm dying to get out
In the glass labyrinth, I am the mouse

See how I fly away (I'm trapped)
It's just a game you
Play here in this labyrinth (I'm trapped)
(I'm trapped)
(I'm trapped)
(I'm trapped)
