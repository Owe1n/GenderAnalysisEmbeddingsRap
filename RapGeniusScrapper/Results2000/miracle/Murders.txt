Murders Lyrics
He was in the forest looking to see the trees
But none were there
He found a girl
She found the Erlking (The lover)
They were in the white wood
Gamboling out to picnic
In the light leaves broke above
Then fell below

I was in the middle ground
Looking to find the
Flowers in the garden
Wearying of the "hate me, hate me not"
Wait, they forgot
Woe, oh the rot!
Deeper in they crept
Oblivious of the bears and darker terrors
Or none were there
How did they dare?

I was in the middle ground looking to find the
Fountain of infinite mirror
Tree falling, no one would hear
Shadow of nobody there
Murders of murderers living in fear of it
Owls on the night watch
Solemn and easily wise to what we thought
They thought above
Sound broke below
They were in the black wood
Coveting indiscreetly her for him
Or him for her
Shown what they were
You might also like
I was in the middle ground looking to find the
Fountain of infinite mirror
Tree falling no one would hear
Shadow of nobody there
Murders of murderers living in fear of it
I was in the clearing
Buzzing around to hearing but the
Bees and birds who knew the words
Soon arrived the twilight
Finally the night and day remembered
How they came to be

All for nothing at all
All for nothing at all
With something to do
I was in the forest
Looking to see the trees
But none were there21Embed
