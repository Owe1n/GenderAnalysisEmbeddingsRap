Stranded Lullaby Lyrics
There's a still tension in the swell
Of dreamt debris afloat amidst the waves and then dispel

Aimless thoughts and papers blown around
A million moments meant remembered rest in deep dark sound
Game the mess

I'd like to know why you are all alone while I'm lost at sea
Maybe we'll be there when you want
Anchorless and unmoored set amiss
Awake would only prove the fantasy made lucid sense
Sail on, sail on

I'd like to know why you are all alone while I'm lost at sea
Maybe we'll be there when you want

There's a still tension in the swell
So give in to the vast receiving emptiness of time
Beyond, beyond

I'd like to know why you are all alone while I...
You're unsure if I am a loose end or a strand
That waits for you to mend or understandYou might also like14Embed
