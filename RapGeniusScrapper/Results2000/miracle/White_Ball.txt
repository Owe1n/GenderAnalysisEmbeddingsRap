White Ball Lyrics
Drift aloft
In some effortless place
Bound by delicate dread
Saving no face
Air dissolves
Where one game is designed
Something's elegant find
So the program goes

(Check it out)
(tniop siht ta ti gniod nuf adnik s'tI)
(Ha)
Fate decides
How these columns align
Birth by chess or benign
Every moment
Marble gods
Tango circles in space
Round the already dead
Hung by staircase up

(ahaH, I panicked-)
(Wow)
(Haha)
(Haha)

On and on
The awakening light
Will bathe slumbers
Of ethereal sights
Today is renewed, is reborn
Each day, I am new, I am yours

So please dismiss
What they claim about this
Being in vain to explain
How expressed with a kiss
Taking passionate steps
Floor suspending abyss

Such impossible bliss
Such impossible bliss
Such impossible bliss
Such impossible bliss
