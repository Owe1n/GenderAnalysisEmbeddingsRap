Brighter Lyrics
I thought I'd write this one for you, ain't seen you in a while
Staring at your picture wishing I was wit cha, miss ya smile
And when I'm wit cha it's like I don't wanna leave again
Without you listen I don't wanna breathe again
You give me a lot and everyday you giving more
So there's no need to tell you who or what I'm living for
I miss ya very much shit I miss ya every touch
And I know you'd come through for me in the clutch
I'm on the road with my peeps and I know I'm moving
But yet the time we spend together that's so soothing
Love it how we do shit I pour a drink for ya
You pour a drink for me and always think of me
I call you when you when I'm home I know you bored and all alone
I wanna come and scope you up and place you in the zone
But we could be together on the right now
Cuddle on the couch, watch some TV, turn the lights down
That's what's up...
Cloudy was the day when sunshine came into my life, and made it brighter
(I can't go a day without my lover)
She's touching me with her warmness as the light shine from her smile
She makes me happy...
(I can't go a day without my lover)

I know I put you through some shit but yet you stayed with me
Messing with them other chicks it's only games they play with me
Searching for something I had with me all the time
I made a change, my love to you I'm giving all of mine
Send you cards in the mail to show you that I care
Shit a life without you is the only thing I fear
So I'm a make sure a nigga hold it down for
The foundation wishing I could be around more
But you know the drama gotta keep a nigga running
I bugged out with the crew it's only you I'm wanting
Call you on the horn to hear you on the other end
"Mental hugging giving my loving to no other men"
This one's personal so keep it close to you
Be there for each other that's what we supposed to do
And anything you want I make sure you get it
And anything you into babygirl you know I'm wit it
Holla when you ready for me...
You might also like

Yeah, listen don't mean to burn your ear out
But this is something you should hear out
Right now
Shit I'd give you the world
I'm a make it home to my babygirl someway or somehow
Ain't afraid to tell ya how your fella feel cuz your fellas real
And on the real girl you're hella chill
I hope you get the message by the end of this
Wanted you from the start, from the heart I'm sending this
This my last gig I'm on my way home
And we can go and paint the town or we can stay home
It don't matter what we do as long as I'm wit you
Spend some time wit you, you know what I'm a do
Get it on wit you just like the first time
There's no need for this man to rehearse mine
Superstar wit ya, back-to-back and far wit ya
Without a doubt I'm going all out for wit ya
