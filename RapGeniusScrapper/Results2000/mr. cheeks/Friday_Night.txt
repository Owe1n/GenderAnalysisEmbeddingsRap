Friday Night LyricsOoohhh...
Mad shit jumpin off, now I like this
Ok, yeah, yeah hey yo
Friday night, just got paid
I'm runnin wit my mans we got plans of gettin laid up
Sticky green burnin sittin on twenty's
Pocket full of money and we hollerin the honeys yo
Stress less of death and we let the chain swing
Makin ??? we out for the same thing
Hittin up the spot where they say is jumpin at
I'm straight ?? and man I'm bringin somethin back
Me and the wild one we just copped a nice one
And two brand new toys fuck the price done
Big nigga style say ? when I switch lanes
Stay doin big thangs smoke while I get brains
Line full of women can't wait to get in
Checkin mo sippin ?? mo spittin
Dancefloor packed do it in the doe stack
Those that hit the C is get it get the ??
Now where the hoes at? Let's get it on and poppin
Invite a few through, that's how the crew do
DJ got the crowd jumpin
The music from the speakers got the floor thumpin
I'm tryna run in sumthin
	
We go straight from the top down to the flo'
We makin the crowds all the while down
Smokin about a pound
You know we be puttin it down
It's Mr. Cheeks and Ho Brown baby
Sex make the beats so crazy
You know we be knockin them out
So what are you talkin about
Yo, I got the cherry on G
With me up in V-I-P
And my bottles damn near empty
I got this chick talkin shit in my ear
Word I think she's tryna tempt me, tempt me
Oh, I see things is on and poppin now
The whole crowds hoppin out
There's no stoppin now
Mad chicks up in ?? all my niggas wit me
My shit takes off like a rocket
While your pockets hurtin
Niggas mad because me and my team we bring the funk
You and ?? motherfucker you gon' talk
I keep my fresh on and the chick keep me me
We mad dollar niggas and we be some sticky green
Holdin shit down
Niggas know what's on and poppin when I hits town
Get down
Honeys wanna take flicks
Take sips of the licks and they shake hips
Oh sho we go
Baby...
Why now...
