On Da Spot Freestyle LyricsI make a motherfucker say
Oh yeah
I'm cold as a lion with no hair
If you ever see me fightin in da forest
With a grizzly bear
HELP DA BEAR
Cause that bitch goin need it
And I'm home and greedy
Gimmie that got damn porridge
But I ain't een goin eat it
I fell out with fall (why)
Fuckin spring
I got into it with summer
Cause I told her that the winter be comin
I had a fight with lightning
Yeah I kicked his ass
I sent him home on a lightning bolt
I ducked the flash but I got a tan
We come together like
The birds and the bees
And the trees and the leaves
And the pots and the pans
But we always fight like cats and dogs
And roaches and raid cans
I say what's happenin my man
Know I'm sayin
What's happening my man
