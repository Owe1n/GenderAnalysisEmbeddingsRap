N.O.R.E. Lyrics
It's like a gun trilogy, gat strategy
What, Noreaga, lay out like your majesty
Aspect mine when y'all niggas hear my par
Have y'all straight wildin when y'all see my car
I step on your toes, fuckin ya hoes, chain reaction
Take toes, stay in my clothes
Keep askin why I keep buckin y'all foes
Gettin sucked now, from my fuckin neck to my toes
Still shootin decent, throwin grenades at the precinct
Henny, Wood, Guinness, mad niggas are gettin finished
Fessin it, my niggas precedent
Gettin head in the whip, but not crashin it
Monster Kode, gang related like O.J
Friends know me, by my first name Victor
Santiago, half-black, half-Fajardo
Dominicano, people like pope hinquihando
Me and Tone from T-M in the B-M
Drink Cristals, won't cancel Seagrams
Yo, N-O-R-E, nore stands for niggas on the run eatin
No matter if you're still treatin
N-O-R-E, nore stands for niggas on the run eatin
No matter if you're still treatin

Yo, it's all reality, my guns blazed for clarity
For charity, had a whole hood ahead of me
Gradually, I casually grab the two Tecs
Blow holes, that'll rip through bird chest
Noreaga, get head inside a L-S
Wise guy's a man is good fellas
Open doors for ladies, never blaze when we see babies
Only shoot when we crash through, when we have to
Made cats sit back, picture that
Yo, respect it, knowin that we now connected
It's like Lefty and Donnie
Lefty let Donnie live, and Donnie snaked him
Stayed for day one, then faked him
The rules of nature, keep your mind on your paper
Them cats that ain't been down is down state now, yo

Yo, N-O-R-E, nore stands for niggas on the run eatin
No matter, if you're still treatin
N-O-R-E, nore stands for niggas on the run eatin
No matter, if you're still treatin
You might also like
Yo, married to marijuana, smoked mad trees
Catch me with the same bitch in Belize
Only fuck a bitch twice if she get on her knees
Shoot for myself, for myself I squeeze
Always hated the cops, yelled, "fuck them pigs"
Let the situation get much bigger than g's
How y'all small cats still runnin round for keys
Switch places, hated when the jack go freeze
Yo, my bank account tripled, when I doubled at least
Had my nigga like c-style, smoke that weed
Mad fucked up, drive benz at high speed
For my niggas on the run, just know to bleed

Yo, N-O-R-E, nore stands for niggas on the run eatin
No matter, if you're still treatin
N-O-R-E, nore stands for niggas on the run eatin
No matter, if you're still treatin
N-O-R-E, nore stands for niggas on the run eatin
No matter, if you're still treatin
N-O-R-E, nore stands for niggas on the run eatin
No matter, if you're still treatin

What, what, what, what, what
Trackmasters, Tone and Poke, what, what
What, what, iraq all of that
Castro, midnight blue, mussolini, sham dulo
A maze, monoray, my boy LP
Moneray, jungle, Esco, what up
Nature, it's all good, gettin that paper
Niggas on the run eatin, what, it's all good where you come from, dun
Bust a gat, represent where you come from, dun
Word up, son, what, what, shit is real, where we come from, dun2Embed
