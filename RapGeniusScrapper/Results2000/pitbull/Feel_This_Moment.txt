TranslationsΕλληνικάFeel This Moment Lyrics
Ask for money and get advice
Ask for advice, get money twice
I'm from the dirty, but that chico nice
Y'all call it a moment, I call it life

One day while my light is glowin'
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I just wanna feel this moment
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I just wanna feel this moment

Mr. Worldwide
Christina Aguilera
Oye, mamita, come on
Dale, que la cosa está rica, jajaja (I just wanna feel this moment)

Woo
Feel this moment

Reporting live from the tallest building in Tokyo
Long ways from them hard ways, bills, Os and oh-yays
Dade County always, 3-0-5, all day
Now, baby, we can parlay or, baby, we can party (Heh)
She read books, especially about red rooms and tie-ups (Yeah)
I got her hooked
'Cause she seen me in a suit with the red tie tied up
Meet and greet, nice to meet ya
But time is money, only difference is I own it
Now let's stop time and enjoy this moment, dale

One day while my light is glowin'
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment

Woah-oh-oh-oh (C'mon)
I just wanna feel this moment
Woah-oh-oh-oh (C'mon)
I just wanna feel this moment

Woo
Come on, feel this moment

I see the future but live for the moment
Make sense, don't it? Ha
Now make dollars, I mean billions (Yeah)
I'm a genius, I mean brilliant (Brilliant)
This street is what schooled him (Schooled him)
And made him slicker than Slick Rick the Ruler (Yeah)
I've lost a lot and learned a lot
But I'm still undefeated like Shula
I'm far from cheap (Ahah)
I break down companies with all my peeps (That's right)
Baby, we can travel the world
And what I can give you is all you can see
Time is money, only difference is I own it
Like a stopwatch, let's stop time and enjoy this moment, dale
One day while my light is glowin'
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment

Woah-oh-oh-oh (C'mon)
I just wanna feel this moment
Oh-woah-oh-oh, ooh-woah (C'mon, yeah)
I just wanna feel this moment

Woo
Come on, feel this moment

Woah-oh-oh-oh
I just wanna feel this moment
Woah-oh-oh-oh
