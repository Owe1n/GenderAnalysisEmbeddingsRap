Body Lyrics
(In) in-, (In) in, (In) in-, (In) in
(In) in-, (In) in, out (Out), woo! (Body)

I'm 'bout to pull up at your crib in the big body
Gotta go, man, the mummy 'bout to catch a body
Mami, if I go down on your body, promise that you won't tell nobody
Don't tell nobody
Daddy left you home alone, now you a homebody
Now you sneakin' every single freakin' weekend, getting naughty
Got you screamin' through the walls, have the neighbors callin' the law
Like they heard a nigga kill somebody (Whoa)
I'm 'bout to do a drive-by, leave your clit wet (Wet)
Let me put the tip in, get my dick wet (Wet)
Red bone take the top off like a Ferrari (Rari)
Now I’m sucking on that body like an infant (Whoa)
Now yo' body burning hot like incense
Got my body all over your body in a deep sweat (Whoa)
Welcome to that Pretty Ricky and the Keith Sweat
Sweatin', fuckin' up them curls, deep set
(In) in-, (In) in, (In) in-, (In) in
(In) in-, (In) in, out (Out), woo! (Body)

My kisses (Body) massage your legs, girl
Then I work my way all over your body
Leadin' (Body) you to the bed
That's where I lay you down
As I stand back (Body) and watch you spread, girl
Oh, na, na, na
Close my eyes (Body) and I swear, I can hear it

Listenin' to your body, oh yeah, body
Listenin' to your body, oh yeah, body (come on)
Listenin' to your

Baby, come and take these jeans off
I'm about to apply this pressure (Pressure)
'Bout to give you this business (Business)
Right in front of this dresser (Ooh)
I'ma spread your legs, then eat it (Eat it)
Goddamn, you wet, Aquafina ('Fina)
That pussy hungry and I'ma feed it
Got that soppy shit, and I need it
Can you feel it all in your throat?
Girl, your head game ain't no joke
Yo' soft skin, soft hips
Make me feel some way with them soft lips
You might also like
(In) in-, (In) in, (In) in-, (In) in
(In) in-, (In) in, out (Out), woo! (Body)

My kisses (Body) massage your legs, girl
Then I work my way all over your body
Leadin' (Body) you to the bed
That's where I lay you down
As I stand back (Body) and watch you spread, girl
Oh, na, na, na
Close my eyes (Body) and I swear I can hear it
Close my eyes and I swear I can hear it

Listening to your body, oh yeah, body
Listening to your body, oh yeah, body
Listening to your body, body, body

(Body, body, body) it's Slick'em
She got the Aquafina, that wet, wet
That baseline, that mic check
Don't bring it by me, I go fast
I'm all gas, no brake pads
I'm from the back like, ah-ha
I'm grabbin' yo' hair like, ah-ha
Bite marks and scratches from your nails on my back
I'm like, "Ah-ha"
I'm goin' dumb in that pleasure girl
Now I'm all in that treasure girl
More meat than a deli, bih'
Call me Slickadello, bih'
Body like a sex weed
Get me high like ecstasy
Ever since I ate the groceries
That thang been gettin' no sleep
I'ma fold you up like a pretzel (That right)
Come get this late night special (That right)
Drunk on the liquor (yeah)
I'ma lay you down and I'ma lick ya
I'ma turn you over then flip ya (In, in)
I'ma toss you up and then stitch ya (In, in)
I'ma paint you up like this picture (In, in)
I'ma show why they call me Slick'em (Out, out, body)

My kisses (Body) massage your legs, girl
Then I work my way all over your body
Leadin' (Body) you to the bed
That's where I lay you down
As I stand back (Body) and watch you spread, girl
Oh, na, na, na
Close my eyes (Body) and I swear, I can hear it

Listenin' to your body, oh yeah, body
Listenin' to your
Body, body, body, body, body...Embed
