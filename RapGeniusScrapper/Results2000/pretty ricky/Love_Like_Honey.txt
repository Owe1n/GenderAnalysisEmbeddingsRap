Love Like Honey Lyrics
I wanna sex you, till you fall fast asleep, in the bedroom, now listen to the headboard
Beat, lay your body down, listen how the mattress
Squeak, I wanna sex you, I ain't stopping
Till I hear you scream ahhhahhhhhhahhh

Your love's like honey, sticky and slow, drip drop like rain drops, girl I gotta have some
More, your love's like ice cream, creamy and slow, tick tock like my clock, baby wind your
Body slow
(yea baby blu whoa) we take walks on the beach, quality time is okey, cause I'm dealing with a
Freak, massage your feet, girl what's up, let your man tear that thang on up, tornado blu have you
Doing back flips, twitching and running, bighting on your lip, flip the scene now you got me
Shacked up, with whips and handcuffs I like it rough, I been naughty give me a whack, wicky
Wicky whacking you slap an you call me daddy makes you happy to give it up gladly, no imitating
You can't be mad at me, cause I rock it properly, and it ain't no jocking me, other women
Just flock to me, but it ain't no digging you it's just you and me, come on now


Dem the lights, let me start kissing on you girl romance, cause your body needs freaking girl
Licking on your neck down to your belly button now baby pull me closer while you get this loving
I got some candles lit, strawberry scent, baby say my name, call me sexy spec, and then we
Switch it up, and roll play, you know I put it down all night and all day

I wanna stroke you up, I wanna lick you down, I wanna give it to you, I wanna make you
Shout, I wanna do you do you do you, I wanna do you do you do you, I wanna give it to you, I wanna
Give it to you, I want you to ride it to the east, I want you to ride it to the west, don't
Wanna go up north, cause down south is the best, I wanna do you do you do you, I wanna do you do
You do you, I wanna give it to you ah now oh, you gotta make the sex cry
You gotta make the sex cry, you gotta make the sex cry, you gotta make the sex cry

I got supplies for you baby, ice cream, baby oil, and strawberries, slick 'em hound is
Known to drive that body crazy, I'm tryna give you something you could feel so close your eyes
And hold on tight, you know how I like 'em 5'5 brown eyes, thick in the thighs slim waist
Pretty face, let me taste your lemon pie, a time machine of freaky things you got me feeling
Like jodeci, I'm licking them thighs, lifting them thighs, who's is this you know it's mine
Temperature rising fantasizing dese n dise I got your body on top of mine, I wanna do you girl
You might also like
I wanna sex you, till you fall fast asleep, in the bedroom, now listen to the headboard
Beat, lay your body down, listen how the mattress squeak, I wanna sex you, I ain't stopping
Till I hear you scream ah
