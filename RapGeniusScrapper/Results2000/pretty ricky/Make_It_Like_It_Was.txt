Make It Like It Was Lyrics( chorus )

First kiss (first kiss)

See the love I have, that I have for you, I can't explain it for you girl, because I've been around the world & I met alot of other girls, but they're nothing like you . . 
No, no, no, no . . 
( verse one - Pleasure )
See I came at it & I came at it, now I'm so addicted like a gambling habit
Cause you was the one here, when I ain't have it
Now you say you leavin me, but I ain't havin it
We put too much in just to pull out, this thang just too good for me to pull out
Girl you know pleasure can't stand to see you cryin, so I'ma love you- or die tryin

Whatz up babi I been wanting ta tell u diz for a very long time

( verse three - Slick )
See pleasure is pain & pain is love, first kiss, first touch, first hug
God had to send you up from above
Two jitterbugs on the back of the bus kissin like we grown ups..
But we broke up, all of the pain we went thru is on us..
A couple months went by, then we woke up
Break up to make up, gurl you know us..
And ya they try, but they'll neva be able to do all of the thingz that u do
They ain't got yo style, yo body n smile, they ain't really off da chain lyke u
Be'cause I showed u how to ride it and u showed me how u like it when itz time fa dat good lovin, u read my mind lyke a psychic
So wheneva im gone, you worry bout yo king to return to a throne
Thats why our love is strong
And u ain't eva gotta worry bout me doin wrong, just long as u come back home
'cause diz where u supposed to be, rite here close to me
On the side of me, babygurl u can ride wit me, 'cause wit chu, datz where im tryna be
U kno I love u gurl!!
( chorus )
That's how people fall in love (in love)

( verse four - Baby Blue )
U kno I love ya
Frozen cup yo wrist, so I can spoil ya
Hold ya...
Neva ignore ya, adore ya, when timez get hard, I'll do anything for ya..
Remember back in da dayz, parkway, catch a early matinee day at the amine'
Rubbin oil of olay on yo body, hot tamalay
Be'cause ur my shorty (be'cause ur my shorty)
Life passes by when ya busy makin planz Ima be ya man, a veteran
A business man, a gentleman, I kno ya so sick and tired of my ignorance
I can't breathe, I can't get no sleep, without chu, my lyfe is incomplete
Picnics at the party, eatin corn on the cob, Real talk, from the start
You got the keyz to my heart, thatz a promise to God
( chorus )
