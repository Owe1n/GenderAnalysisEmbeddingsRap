Nothing But a Number Lyrics
Yeah, this your boy Pleasure
The fine Pleasure
To all the ladies who like pleasure
Age ain't nothin' but a number
Pretty Ricky and the Mavericks, let's go (It ain't nothin' but a number)
It ain't nothin' but a number (It ain't nothin' but a number)
Ain't nothin' but a number (It ain't nothin' but a number)
It ain't nothin' but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number, ayy
You say it's because of my age, girl
But age ain't nothin' but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number (Number, baby)
You say it's because of my age, girl
But age ain't nothin' but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number (Number, baby)

I'm a young man, but my dick grown up
I like to beat it open, legs over shoulders
I'm the one you call when you wanna get fucked
Hit you in the house, in the car, in the truck
Baby, bend over, let me hit it from the back
I'ma show you how Stella got her groove back
Have you feelin' like a lil' girl sneakin' from your boyfriend
Leaving your window cracked
I get a phone call everyday, weekly
Legs open very easy, the meanin' of "L-O-V-E"
Baby Blue, B-A-B-Y B-L-U-E
Have you spelling out my name in your sleep
I beat that drum like the energizer bunny
Keep goin' and goin', goin' and goin'
Show you that an old man can't do your body like I can
I'll flip it, I could use a lil' moanin'
You might also like
You say it's because of my age, girl
But age ain't nothin' but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number (Number, baby)
You say it's because of my age, girl
But age ain't nothin' but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number (Number, baby)

I know you been goin' through some changes
People got you angling in different directions
Now it's time for the best
Sit down on the bed, girl, let me teach you a lesson
I'm talkin' 'bout havin' sex
And a little romance, and a little affection
I'm talkin' 'bout headboard bangin'
Forget about them other ones
Ain't nobody gonna do you like I
Age ain't nothin' but a number, girl
I'm tryna blow your mind and make you wonder, girl
I'm tryna hit you with this thunder, girl
I'm tryna make this bedroom rumble, girl
So, turn the page to another chapter
'Cause you who I'm after, nothin' else matter
I'm your servant, you my master
I'm tryna climb this ladder to happily ever after, girl
You say it's because of my age, girl
But age ain't nothin' but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number (Number, baby)
You say it's because of my age, girl
But age ain't nothin' but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number (Number, baby)

Don't waste no time, just gimme your hand
Let's walk on the sand, spend a couple of grand
Approachin' your body with sex appeal
On the real, me and you could just chill
I'm talkin' 'bout black action, satisfaction
Guarantee you whip lashes on your back
Girl, my love is everlasting (Everlasting)
I wanna sign ya, and wine and dine ya
Spin you like DJ Rhyma
Suck on your neck like a vampire
You a bomb 'bout to blow up, all you need is a big timer
Don't worry 'bout age 'cause I'm 21, 'bout mines

You say it's because of my age, girl
But age ain't nothin' but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number (Number, baby)
You say it's because of my age, girl
But age ain't nothin' but a number
It ain't nothin' but a number (Number, baby)10Embed
