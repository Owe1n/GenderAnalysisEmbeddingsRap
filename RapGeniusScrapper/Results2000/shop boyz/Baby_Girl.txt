Baby Girl Lyrics
Yahhh hooo!
Aye baby girl
Say baby girl
Aye come here girl
Aye you can be my baby girl
Aye baby girl
Say baby girl
Aye come here girl
Aye you can be my baby girl
Aye do you wanna be my
Baby girl
Aye let me take you round the
Whole wide world
And u can pick a pretty city
Down in flordia
Holdin hands in the sand
Or take a flight across the water
Hugged up til we land
Rice & steak up in china
Or we can kick it in japan
Or we can just stay home
And shop til u drop
I'm just sayin
Put some ice on ya ear
Neck, wrist & ya hand
You prolly tell me you don't want it
But I know that you just playin
Aye baby girl
Say baby girl
Aye come here girl
Aye you can be my baby girl
Aye baby girl
Say baby girl
Aye come here girl
Aye you can be my baby girl
What's up?
Come here uh

Don't miss ya blessing girl
Cause ya life I can change
Ain't with no bullshit
I ain't tryna play no games
Just loosin up a lil gotta be a shame

Wanna kick it witcha

To make u be my baby
Shoppin sprees down at lennox
Got the keys to the mercedes

Let's come togetha like some stitches
Stead of keepin yo lil distance
These yo feelins that you playin with
Forget the one you staying with
Cause I ain't the one to be playin with
When I'm the one you laying with
I know I'm bein manish
But please undastand this
You gotta be my girl I demand it
Aye baby girl
Say baby girl
Aye come here girl
Aye you can be my baby girl
Aye baby girl
Say baby girl
