Next To Me LyricsShe knows what I want
She knows what I like
She knows when i'm wrong
She knows when i'm right
She knows what it takes to get next to me
(She knows what it takes to get next to me)
Girl:
I know what you want
I know what you like
I know when you're wrong
I know when you're right
She knows what it takes to get next to me

Ay well apparently, you the only girl that can handle me
Take care of me, for various shit i can see that you cherish me
You selfishly get mad when them other bitches stare at me
Im glad to see that you can hold me down like gravity
I have to be stupid just to ever ever cheat on you
I lean on you, and in the bed the only time i beat on you
What we go through is different we fight and then get intimate
This shit here gettin' serious and marriage now i'm sensin it
I need some time just to get my thoughts, to get a piece of mind
I know that i broke your heart, so you can get a piece of mine
We been fine cuz we done made it through the decent time
They wanna know why i wanna make you my wife
She knows what I want
She knows what I like
She knows when i'm wrong
She knows when i'm right
She knows what it takes to get next to me
(She knows what it takes to get next to me)

You were down for me girl when noone was
When i was down and i was out you gave me kisses and hugs
I paid you little attention you always showed me love
Not knowing you were an angel from the heavens above
And when i'm down to my leg you say i got what you need
And when try to offer somethin it's hard for me to receive
Always said when i'm in need you'd be down for me
Spend a life time with me, you love and care for me
And when we out and about you show me love and affection
And when i needed some advice you answer all of my questions
I'm kind of confused right now and my mind got me guessin
I see you know what i want and to my heart you a blessin
She knows what I want
She knows what I like
She knows when i'm wrong
She knows when i'm right
She knows what it takes to get next to me

I got, a few friends but one know how to get next to me
The same one thats stressin me, the one who got the best of me
I know i shouldn't mess with her cuz now she always mess with me
Why she always buck on me and try and see whats up with me
And now she gettin worse ever since i started rappin
( )
Got me goin all slappy, baby we ain't got no ties
Ain't got the nerve to say what happened to us i guess it died
I don't need no drama don't call my phone now the money comin in
And you tryna get you some, had a n**** that was good but your the one who
Choose to doubt it and she know me like a book but the sad thing about it
She knows what I want
She knows what I like
She knows when i'm wrong
She knows when i'm right
She knows what it takes to get next to me
