They Lookin At My Jewls
And They See A Player Icy
They Kick It Like They Cool
But I Can Tell They Wanna Fight Me
I Keep The Girls Choosin
Turn Em Out & Have Em Dikin
They Neva Tell Me Naw
Why?
Cause They Like Me
Aye Man Hold Up Please
Girl You See This Bling
Don't You See These Diamonds
What That Is?
Its Shinin Things
Look At All My Rings
Compliment My Bracelet
I Think My Chain Stank
Cause Ppl Makin Ugly Faces
I Had 2 Girls At The Same Time
