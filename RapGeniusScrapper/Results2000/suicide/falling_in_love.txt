â€‹falling in love Lyrics
You absolutely can overcome your addiction
That's what we've been doing for over twenty-five years is helping individuals realize there is something better in their life for them
You know, we offer a pretty unique setting here
A place that is serene and calm
It gets you in the right room of mind so you can move forward with your life

I got out of my car
I could have fallen down in the yard
And looked up at the stars
But I don't like stars
And I don't know where you are
And all I ever knew about falling in love was wrong

I went inside
And fell down on my bed
I could have hit my head
On a million different things
But it's not my time to die

And all I ever knew about falling in love was wrongYou might also like7Embed
