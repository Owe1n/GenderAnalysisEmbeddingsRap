â€‹lonely boy goes to a rave Lyrics
School sucks
Why, oh why is there work?
I don't get it
Mmm... look at me, look at my face
Does it look like I care about school?
No...


All his friends are hanging out
Doing stuff without him now
No girlfriend, he's alone
Feeling sad, feeling down
Lonely boy has a plan
To take some drugs, to make new friends
To go to a rave where he can be
Surrounded by the people he wants to be
