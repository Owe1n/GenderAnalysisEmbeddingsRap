​we found two dead swans and filled their bodies with flowers Lyrics
I don’t want to go to sleep
And I don’t want to dream
On a table or on the floor
In a car outside at night in the snow

Waking up in someone else’s bed
Something tells me I’m losing my head
I don’t want to leave
Just dye my hair and sleep
The world is ending in my dreams
Every week for the last few years
And when it really ends they’ll fill my body with flames
You and I will be a household nameYou might also like16Embed
