‚Äçthe same things happening to me all the time, even in my dreams Lyrics
Spill the blood of the innocent


I have dreamt about what it's like to die
And I saw myself becoming shadows again
Just like I did when I was a kid
I saw my bones crack open and all the things I've been hiding from you spill out
All the secrets that I never thought I'd tell anyone about
I am warm and I am bored and I am drifting through this place
It's no better or worse than anything else that's ever happened to me
But I wish that I'd never met a lot of the people that I've met
Not because I don't like them but because I only let them down
And when you disappoint everyone all the time, it's hard not to want to die
Constantly, I feel this weird and shameful feeling
Like I'm being watched by a thousand glowing, vengeful eyes
Behind one-way mirrors in public bathrooms and in metro cars
And everywhere I go, I know I'm not welcomeYou might also like25Embed
