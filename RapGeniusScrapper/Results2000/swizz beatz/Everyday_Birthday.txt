Everyday Birthday Lyrics
Now, every day is your birthday, now hit the floor
Every day is your birthday, now hit the floor
Every day is your birthday, now hit the floor
Hi-hit the floor, I say hit the floor
Every day is your birthday, now hit the floor
Every day is your birthday, now hit the floor
Every day is your birthday, now hit the floor
Hi-hi the floor, and dance like a white girl
Let's work, let's work
Let's work, let's work
Watcha think you doing in here?  Girl, I got 100 bottles of that Rozay, hoes they always be in my ear
Girl, I got a problem solver, lean back and swallow
Make this liquor all disappear, drop it, drop it, this your chance, girl
Money all in my pants, girl, it's your night so dance like a white girl

Now, every day is your birthday, now hit the floor
Every day is your birthday, now hit the floor (Crazy)
Every day is your birthday, now hit the floor (It's your night)
Hi-hit the floor, I say hit the floor
Every day is your birthday, now hit the floor (Ha)
Every day is your birthday, now hit the floor (Crazy)
Every day is your birthday, now hit the floor (Ha)
Hi-hi the floor, I say hit the floor (Leggo)

This goes out to the 305's
718's I mean all the states (Crazy)

You better call the cops, baby girl, just stop
This white chain, ice
This Tourbillon, motherfucker, passed out (Ha)
Man we on the floor all night
She wanna go crazy and plus dance like a white girl (Woo, leggo)
Told you before, it's me, bitch (Crazy)
Y'all talk too much, y'all might be snitches
I don't do the dirty work, yeah, I do the dishes
I just lay the fuck back and just count my digits (Ha)
Br-br-br-bring it back and rewind (Crazy)
I could bug out, go crazy, I'm ou-out of my mind
Got Ciroq on deck, got Patron on deck
Y'all crazy man you had think you next (Ha)
She all on the floor with the spandex on
She got the red bottoms on, man, she get it on (Crazy)
Uh, uh, man I get it on

The party's in your glass, you fill it up until you hit the roof (Woo, ah, woo, ah)

She dancing too but she killing that shit (Yeah)
She acting like a white girl drunk
And she outta control but I'm feeling that bitch (Woo)
Drop it like you owe it to me (Owe it to me)
Give it to me like it's mine in the first place (In the first place)
Lady in the street, freak in the bed
Wild in the party, professional in the workplace (Ow)
She independent and sexy I think I love her, man (I love her)
She keep it clean but get messy under the cover, man (Dance like a white girl)
Dirty, yeah, you know it clap your ass
If you dirty and you know it, clap your ass

It's got a whore-a-million uses and I get all the exclusives
And damn, that body so ruthless, now dance to what Swizz producing
