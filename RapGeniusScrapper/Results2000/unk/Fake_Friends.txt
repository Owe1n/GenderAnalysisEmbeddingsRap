Fake Friends LyricsYou call me a friend as you  pull out a knife
You stab me in the back, not once but twice
Friends for life, but that’s a straight up lie
You ain't gotta clue, about Ride or Die
I’m surrounded by wolves that are dressed like sheep
Telling straight lies, dry snitching on me
Claiming it wasn’t you, behind the line up glass
You straight pointed out me, to save your own ass
I’d rather sweat buckets, to search out peace
Than spilling gallons of blood, fighting demons in me
The battle continues, frighten the anger within
It’s a full time job, dealing with FAKE ASS FRIENDS
Ever time I think I know, what you’ll do next
You end up selling me out, for a yard or less
You made you a dollar, so I’m screaming again
You’re a straight up punk, a FAKE ASS FRIEND
I can sit and formulate a plan in my head
Take a sniper shot; make your FAKE ASS DEAD
Now I’m on the run, a fugitive at large
Ain't a FAKE ASS FRIEND around, worth taking a
Charge
Their a dime a dozen, you can find them anywhere
Just don’t be fooled, because its buyer beware
It’s a known street rule, don’t say it wasn’t said
Because FAKE ASS FRIENDS, usually wined up dead
But ill take what GOD gave me common sense, and
Walk away
It’s a soft ass move, but Ill write another day
Not locked up covered up, dealing with my sins
Nothing wrong with cutting off, a FAKE ASS FRIEND
Ain't a chick or dude around, can’t relate to what I’m
Saying
We all had friends, which were straight perpetrating
Saying they got our back, all the way to the end
Same ole same ole, just a FAKE ASS FRIEND
So now I ride solo, I know it’s a risk
If push comes to shove, Ill add my girl to the list
Now I’m RICH and FAMOUS, and you wanna make
Amends
But as I told you before, FUCK FAKE ASS FRIENDS!You might also like3Embed
