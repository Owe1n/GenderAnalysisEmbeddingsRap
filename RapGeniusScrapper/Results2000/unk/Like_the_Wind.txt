Like the Wind Lyrics
Like the wind, you came running
Take the consequence of living
There's no space, there's no tomorrow
Thereâ€™s no sense for communication

Check it in, check it out
Or the sun will never shine
There a long dirty way
In the subways of your mind
Like the wind, you're going somewhere
Let a smile be your companion
There's no place, and there's no sorrow
In the young and restless dreamer

Check it in, check it out
Or the sun will never shine
There a long dirty way
In the subways of your mind


Check it in, check it out
Or the sun will never shine
There a long dirty way
In the subways of your mind

Check it in, check it out
It's the summer blues
Tell it in, tell it out
It's a real excuse
Check it in, check it out
It's the summer blues
Tell it in, tell it out
It's a real excuse
Check it in, check it out
It's the summer blues
Tell it in, tell it out
It's a real excuse
Check it in, check it out
It's the summer blues
Tell it in, tell it out
It's a real excuseYou might also like12Embed
