Pharaoh, Pharaoh (Standard Version) Lyrics
I say Pharaoh, Pharaoh
Oh baby let my people go!
Huh! Yeah, yeah, yeah
I say Pharaoh, Pharaoh
Oh baby let my people go!
Huh! Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, the burning bush told me just the other day
That I should come over here and say
Got to get my people out of Pharaoh's hand
And lead them on over to the Promised Land
I say Pharaoh, Pharaoh
Oh baby let my people go!
Huh! Yeah, yeah, yeah
I say Pharaoh, Pharaoh
Oh baby let my people go!
Huh! Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, all of God's people came to the Red Sea
With Pharaoh's army coming after me
I raised my rod, stuck it in the sand
And all of God's people walked across dry land

I say Pharaoh, Pharaoh
Oh baby let my people go!
Huh! Yeah, yeah, yeah
I say Pharaoh, Pharaoh
Oh baby let my people go!
Huh! Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, all of Pharaoh's army was coming too
So what do you think that I did do?
I raised my rod and cleared my throat
And all of Pharaoh's army did the dead man's float
You might also like
I say Pharaoh, Pharaoh
Oh baby let my people go!
Huh! Yeah, yeah, yeah
I say Pharaoh, Pharaoh
Oh baby let my people go!
Huh! Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, that's the story of the stubborn goat
Pharaoh should've known that chariots don't float
The lesson is simple, it's easy to find
When God says, "GO!" you had better mind!Embed
