Unknown Freestyle Lyrics
I stepped in the game I blew up quick like land mines
Every shot that I bust at niggas I land mines
I own acres now all this land mines
I copped both rovers the range and the land mines
Niggas schemin' on me got the kid light on ice
That why I sticked to my burner like white on rice

I'm like death
'Cause nobody alive gonna take me
I'ma do me till the FBI gon' chase me
Fiens be on the block looking funny and shaky
I'ma take a trip to where ever my money can take me
And I'm trigga happy waiting for a nigga to front
I need to clap something I ain't shoot a nigga in months
There ain't nothing you can tell me to help you clown
I'm 'bout to cock the hammer and nail you down
And I got over a hundred weapons in my gun collection
Niggas call me when they want protection
But everyday I gotta blaze something
'Cause niggas in the hood stay fronting
Chill dubs you ain't got to say nothing
Why you mad for
Mad cause my chain flooded
Or because I walk the streets with it like it ain't nothing
I fuck bitches and give it to 'em how they want it
Turn 'em over and throw away up in they stomach
And when I'm finshed I pass 'em off to my eight cousin
Every hoe I boned I got 'em on tape fucking
Walk in the stage spot spend about 800
Walk in the liquor store henny or it ain't nothing blud they shake me.They dont wanna hate me
Just 'cause I'm hornyYou might also like6Embed
