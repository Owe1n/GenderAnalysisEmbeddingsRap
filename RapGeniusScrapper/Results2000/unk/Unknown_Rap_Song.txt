Unknown Rap Song Lyrics
Rub your titties
If you nice weave

Fuck you
You a pussy nigga anyway
While you talk about me
Tell'em how I rode your face
Memphis Ten where we get it in
Money over everything
Chicks be fucking just to win
First 48 is the scene
I can kill a bitch dream
Till you see me in my jeans
If that's ya nigga
Tell him stay up out my ringer
Bout to clock it back
Watch me shoot my middle finger
Like
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Jive records I said
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Michelle from Straight from the ass blog I'm like
Fuck you
Fuck you
Smelling like a fish market
Fuck you
Fuck you
You angry bitches I'm like
Fuck you
I'm all give y'all some T-shirt that say
I hate K.Michelle
All you hating bitch

Fuck you
And them bitches that you came with
Why ugly bitches always wanna talk the most shit
Dumb shit sweet valley high shit
Really man fuck you and your whole clique
I'm from Memphis
Jump a gate slap a bitch
I ain't in the streets
And I ain't with that shit
I see a lot of niggas
But not a lot of men
All of a sudden stranger bitches tryna be my friend

Fuck you
For real tho I don't know none of you hoes I don't
Fuck you
Fuck you
Tell Sally Mann
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
To that flight attendant
That didn't want to get me another drink
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck youYou might also like15Embed
