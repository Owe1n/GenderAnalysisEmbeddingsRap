So no
Baby... Oh...
I-I-I
Heyyyy

Beautiful girl and that's for sure
The way she made love, me haffi request more
She gave me even on the wooden floor
Said she wants a man like me in her life
Nuff compliments and me bounce her right
She talked about it each and every night...
I don't wanna talk about
What I had before
So what I wanna do right now
Is give you love galore
Baby...

Bounce along, bounce along
Only you can turn me on
Bounce along, bounce along
Bounce along, bounce along
Only you can turn me on
Bounce along, bounce along

I'm heading over heels just for you
Loving every single thing you do
Clearly I can see you want me too
Lately I've been talking to my self
Saying, "I don't need nobody else"
"Cause all I'm searching for I found in you"

I don't wanna sleep alone
Without you in my bed
'Cause when you're not around, my love
It's messing up my head
Baby...

Bounce, Bounce
Bounce Along (8x)

I don't wanna sleep alone
Without you in my bed
Cause when you're not around my love
It's messing up my head
Baby...
