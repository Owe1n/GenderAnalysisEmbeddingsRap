Hold Me Now LyricsNo, no, Wayne Wonder
I have a picture pinned to my wall
An image of you and of me
And we're laughing, we're loving it all
But look at our life now, we're tattered and torn
We fuss and we fight and we lied in your tears
And we cry until dawn
Hold me now, warm my heart
Stay with me, let loving start
Let loving start
You say I'm a dreamer, we're two of a kind
Both of us searching for some perfect world
We know we'll never find, no, no
So perhaps, I should leave here, yeah, yeah, go far away
But you know there is no where that
I'd rather be than with you here today
Hold me now, warm my heart
Stay with me, let loving start
Let loving start
Hold me now, warm my heart
Stay with me, let loving start
Let loving start
You ask if I love you, well, what can I say?
You know that I do and that this
Is just one of those games that we play
So I'll sing you a new song, please don't cry anymore
I'll ask you forgiveness
Though I don't know just what I'm asking you for
Hold me now, warm my heart
Stay with me, let loving start
Let loving start

Stay with me, let loving start
Let loving start
Hold me now, warm my heart
Stay with me, let loving start
Let loving startEmbed
