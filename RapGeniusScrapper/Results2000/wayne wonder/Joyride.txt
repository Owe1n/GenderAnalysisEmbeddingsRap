Joyride Lyrics
Wayne Wonder:
Oooh yeah

Taking a ride, a ride, a ride, a ride, a joyride
Me an' some honeys
Taking a ride, a ride, a ride, a ride, a joyride
Me an' some honeys

Cruising around wid a Jeep full a honeys
Each one want to introduce a-me a-to their mommies
Some want me pack up an' come over wid me luggage
The ride not only smooth, it will be rugged
My loving attitude extremely cold bloodied
If you want to ride, make sure you can manage
My daily menu is some peanut porridge
What's left to do is to do some damage
Taking a ride, a ride, a ride, a ride, a joyride
Me an' some honeys
Taking a ride, a ride, a ride, a ride, a joyride
Me an' some honeys

It's another day
The breeze is blowing
Like no other day
So let's get going
Got to get away
The vibe is flowing
Take you on the bay
Take it away

Taking a ride, a ride, a ride, a ride, a joyride
Me an' some honeys
Taking a ride, a ride, a ride, a ride, a joyride
(Baby Cham: Ain't coming back, you know?)
Me an' some honeys

I request de honeys whether black or the browns
Taking a joyride cruise on the the town
Big fat Patsy waan loose a couple poun'
Watch de one Princess she sexy an' roun'
It's another day
The breeze is blowing
Like no other day
So lets get going
Got to get away
The vibe is flowing
Take you on the bay
Take it away
You might also like
Taking a ride, a ride, a ride, a ride, a joyride
Me an' some honeys
Taking a ride, a ride, a ride, a ride, a joyride
(Baby Cham:  me and some honeys)
Me an' some honeys

Cruising aroung wid a Jeep-load a honeys
Each one want to introduce a-me a-to their mommies
Some want me pack up an come over wid me luggage
The ride not only smooth, it will be rugged
My loving attitude extremely cold bloodied
If you want to ride, make sure you can manage
Don't forget de big basket wid some sandwich
Yuh know? Wid some sandwich

Ah, just me an' the honeys
 honeys
Ah, just me an' some honeys
 honeys

I request the honeys whether black or browns
Stranger an me on a cruise on de town
Big fat Patsy waan loose a couple poun'
Watch de one Princess she sexy an roun'
Ah love to she de girl dem inna dem skin fit gown
Whether yuh black an me say whether yuh brown
Me say Baby Cham an Waynie Wonder ruling de townEmbed
