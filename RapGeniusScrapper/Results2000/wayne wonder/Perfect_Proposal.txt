Perfect Proposal LyricsThis is for my baby
Will you marry me?
(Will you?)
By your side I'll be
(Pretty lady)
Will you marry me?
(Will you?)
By your side I'll be
I think it's time to be a host to my baby
I think it's time make a toast to my baby
I think it's time to just propose to my lady

You're truly the best, a bless, the greatest girl I know
You made my life worth living, baby and it shows
I want to have you closer to me, to feel happy home
I want to promise that I'll never leave you alone
For one thing I'm really sure for you my love has no end
And nothing in this world can separate us, so until then
I think it's time to be a host to my baby
I think it's time make a toast to my baby
I think it's time to just propose to my lady

Not a day go by that I don't think of you
Sitting here contemplating will my dreams come true
No one is perfect in life, but you're so perfect for me
I can't describe how your love sets me free
My life won't be okay until you're by my side
Without you I'd be empty, so be my bride
