Saddest Day Lyrics
The saddest day of my life
The saddest day of my life
The saddest day of my life
Yeah
The saddest day of my life
The saddest day of my life
The saddest day of my life
Yes

The saddest day of my life
Is when she left me with a broken heart
I was feeling the pain
The pain, the pain
The saddest day in my life
Is when she left me with a broken heart
I was going insane
Yes
Tried to erase all the memories
They're the ones that haunts me
If I could forget, all about the past
How long will this go on?

The saddest day of my life
Is when she left me with a broken heart
I was feeling the pain
The pain, the pain
The saddest day in my life
Is when she left me with a broken heart
I was going insane
I-I-I

I wish that my thoughts could rewind the hands of time
Then we would be so happy
What if my dreams never meant to be
Then I'd be living in misery
Girl

The saddest day of my life
Is when she left me with a broken heart
I was feeling the pain
Ohhhh
The saddest day in my life
Is when she left me with a broken heart
I was going insane
I-I-I

Broken heart is hard to mend
I'll be your lover, I'll be your friend
To every start there is an end
I wanna be forever, baby
Hey

The saddest day in my life
Is when she left me with a broken heart
I was feeling the pain
Oh baby
The saddest day in my life
Is when she left me with a broken heart
I was going insane
I-I-I

How to erase all the memories?
They're the ones that haunts me
If I could forget, all about the past
How long will this go on?
Yes

The saddest day of my life
Is when she left me with a broken heart
I was feeling the pain
Ohhhh baby
The saddest day in my life
Is when she left me with a broken heart
I was going insane...2Embed
