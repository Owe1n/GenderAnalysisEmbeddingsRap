Get Buck Lyrics
Yeah
Get 'em, Buck!

Okay (Okay), I'm reloaded (Yeah)
My bankroll swole, and a nigga can't fold it (Nah)
I got em like ("Hey!"), got 'em rolling
The kush on the way and the champagne frozen
Watch me do my thing, I got these hoes open (Yeah)
I'm riding presidential like the shit that I'm smoking (Tss)
Water-whip the work (Work), Patrón on my shirt
And a zip ain't shit, I need a quarter-P of Purp (Yeah)
Go and break it down, pass it all around
I can serve Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown
Them dope boys in this bitch, like, "Let me buy that" (Ayy)
Broke niggas in this bitch like, "Let me try that" (Try that)
I need a beat and a bitch (Whoa), let me call Polow (What)
Mr. Ten-a-Key, I still get 'em for the low, though (Aight)
Shawty, light up the 'dro, I ain't ready to go (Nah)
You can't ban me from the radio or fuck up my show, you know!
Haters trying to ban a nigga, man (What? It's okay)
I bounce back, watch me do my thing (Aight, it's okay)
I got my Chevy hogging up the lane (C'mon, it's okay)
I'm a boss, I can make it rain (Yeah, it's okay)

Now get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing)
Get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing, let's go)
Get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing)
Get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing)
Get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing)
Get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing)
Get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing)
Get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing)

Let's play the game, I'm the quarterback (Okay), don't stop, homie
I go to jail if I get sacked (Yeah), so block for me
Eightball in my corner pocket (What), it's on and popping
Got the whole club leaning with it and body-rocking (Hey)
Drunk driving in my cut, dog, I got my truck parked (Truck parked)
Seventy-two Tennessee Titan, like, "What up, y'all?"
I'm home, boy, holler at your homeboy (Yeah)
Better come quick—once I get it, then it's gone, boy
First come, first serve (Ayy), fuck what you heard
I'm piecing out my pack 'til I come up on a bird (Come on)
Blow the smoke out my nose, pimping on these hoes (Yeah)
They know me at the bank, love me at the jewelry stores
I play it how it goes (What), the butterfly doors (What)
On them old-school vogues with the chrome on the toes (Yeah)
These fuck niggas know that I will let it go
("I—I—I bet he got a vest") No! But I got my 'Tec, though
You might also like
Haters trying to ban a nigga, man (What? It's okay)
I bounce back, watch me do my thing (Aight, it's okay)
I got my Chevy hogging up the lane (Come on, it's okay)
I'm a boss, I can make it rain (Yeah, it's okay)

Now get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing, hey)
Get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing, let's go)
Get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing, come on)
Get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing)
Get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing)
Get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing)
Get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing)
Get buck, bitch (Yeah, watch me do the damn thing)

Yeah
You know what it is
How we do the damn thing down here, nigga
What you working with?
Yeah
Ayy, my nigga
Now, don't be in the club
Throwing your rent money, be broke in the morning
Have us laughing at your broke ass
Ha, yeah
Where my dope boys at?
Yeah! Shawty, I see you
Now pick up that goddamn money
Hey
Let's go!8Embed
