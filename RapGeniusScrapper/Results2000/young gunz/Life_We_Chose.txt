Life We Chose Lyrics
Uh feel my pain, chea uh-huh
Uh, Young Gunnas, Chris and Neef
It's real shit
North of Death, home of Philly
Uh, chea uh

Lights is gettin' dimmer
Nights gettin' colder
Lost three of my soldiers
Life feel like it's over
Unloading there's something in my way
They'll never take me alive
I got something on the way
I'ma survive I'mma try to do straight
Try to make it alive, be around for
That due date
But it's hard, niggas hating em hard
That loss hurt to the heart
But still they say it's they fault, we blame y'all
Nigga how, nigga please
It's still on baby
Tell them niggas have they steel off safety
What about them other fake dudes that he grew up wit
Elementary middle school up wit
Man them niggas was there ain't move yet
I'm startin' to think they had somethin' to do wit it
I used to think them niggas was scared
It's lookin' a little shaky now
Niggas happy his little brother's snappin now, his mother hate me now
Even though it hurts some days
This is the game we chose to play
Not everything in life is gold but it will be okay
Now a bullet ain't got no aim
And y'all know bullets ain't got no name
But this is the life we chose
And it will never change

Everyday we reminisce about that three day trip
Same night that we left, got a call you hit
Thought you was still wit us, aimed at me that he flipped
Got a call from Aunt peaches found out where you was hit
Three hit himself who missed him and you just a couple inches
You don't know how much you miss him, bullshittin' in the kitchen
Ninety percent fist fights leadin' to them slammers
But lil' Drake ain't understand until one of them niggas vanish
This rap shit is crazy but believe me I'mma try
Whether happened or not homie I got lil' five
And with the real ones I'mma slice my pies
As you would of wanted, man I'm so sick to my stomach
That you ain't around enjoyin' the fruits of our labors
Shit's about to get major, and these niggas really hate us
Around for nothin' givin' me teeth and palms
Man I don't pay 'em no mind, just try to focus and rhyme ya know
You might also like

Aunt peaches that's where you can reach us
Cook out every other til' they took a nigga brother
Love ya like a brother so I try to take ya brother
And he be on some other shit, I be tryin' to tell 'em man
I seen how you feel
He had intentions on killin' my big brother
Just to let me see how he feel
Tellin' me his life over fuckin' cops
They know they after, run before they catch him he got people to kill
That boy crazy, he got people for real
He gone wind up layin' somewhere peaceful for real
Like he the only one goin' through the pain
Like his mom and Aunt peaches ain't goin' through the same
Cool one minute, then he goin' through a change
I don't need that around, keep the heaters around
Just like the rest of the niggas that I leave in the town
So I separate myself, I look better wit myself
