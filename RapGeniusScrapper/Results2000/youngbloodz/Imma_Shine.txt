Imma Shine Lyrics
I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' feel it and you gon' get it
I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' get it and you gon' feel it
I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' feel it and you gon' get it
I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' get it and you gon' feel it

I'ma shine, I'ma make it
It ain't nothing to it, to it, I'll take it
I feel it, I'll flip it
Pull it, pull it 'til straight get it
I'ma climb, I ain't waiting
There's no end to the money I'm making
For streeting, for chasing we get it in
Might, might be the crunk hating
If ya don't believe you don't succeed
And if ya don't apply you won't achieve
Keep ya head up high, feet down low
And follow your heart to get to the door
If there is a will, here's a way
Never trust a soul I'm here to say
Stop depending and be yourself
And grab a hold and don't look left
So take a swing now here's your chance
You got nothing to lose, make a stance
See the clock is ticking and time ain't waiting
When ya all alone see that's what you're facing

I'ma shine, I'ma make it
It ain't nothing to it, to it, I'll take it
I feel it, I'll flip it
Pull it, pull it 'til straight get it
I'ma climb, I ain't waiting
There's no end to the money I'm making
For streeting, for chasing we get it in
Might, might be the crunk hating

Ya I know I'ma make it, I was meant for this
I'ma with ya in the eye looking for the ten for this
And I don't steal I pimp for this
Ride 'round with a hundred round clip for this
What happened to the struggle, it's called eviction notice
Now people strong self-eviction notice
Prescription cops serve keep it real and fine
But if I get caught with it I'll face some time
And it's hard being young and rich trying to survive
Trying to keep a shot to shine on the poor headed ties
Couple mill and I buy new whip for the wife
Talk that shit but this is my life
You might also like
I'ma shine, I'ma make it
It ain't nothing to it, to it, I'll take it
I feel it, I'll flip it
Pull it, pull it 'til straight get it
I'ma climb, I ain't waiting
There's no end to the money I'm making
For streeting, for chasing we get it in
Might, might be the crunk hating

I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' feel it and you gon' get it
I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' get it and you gon' feel it
I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' feel it and you gon' get it
I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' get it and you gon' feel it

I'ma shine, I'ma make it
It ain't nothing to it, to it, I'll take it
I feel it, I'll flip it
Pull it, pull it 'til straight get it
I'ma climb, I ain't waiting
There's no end to the money I'm making
For streeting, for chasing we get it in
Might, might be the crunk hating
I'ma shine, I'ma make it
It ain't nothing to it, to it, I'll take it
I feel it, I'll flip it
Pull it, pull it 'til straight get it
I'ma climb, I ain't waiting
There's no end to the money I'm making
For streeting, for chasing we get it in
Might, might be the crunk hating; I'ma shine

I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' feel it and you gon' get it
I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' get it and you gon' feel it (I'ma shine)
I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' feel it and you gon' get it
I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' get it and you gon' feel it

I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' feel it and you gon' get it
I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' get it and you gon' feel it
I'm gon' get it and we gon' get it
And you gon' feel it and you gon' get it
I'm gon' get itEmbed
