Yeah yeah yeah whatchu lookin at nigga whatchu lookin at
Whatchu lookin at bitch whatchu lookin at

Now whatchu lookin at now whatchu lookin at

Nigga whatchu lookin at bitch whatchu lookin at

I ride woozie with some motherfucking wood
Still hangin and slangin yea for beat at my hood
Ay go get to it talking big boy shit
Mean muggin like a motherfucker my head on my dick
Bitch I can shake with your help nigga we buck ass wild
We get crunk I got the truth I bought that destinys child
Slide to the ride bitch where a nigga don't dance
What I look like out there juking with this gat in my pants
I put this thing to your back make you throw out your hands
My bull is shit ali a nigga spill some hen on your pants
I'm unruly seem like I don't give a damn
Maybe cause I don't motherfucker understand (understand)
I'm bout foolish I'm what I motherfucking said
I put a peep hole in your head I'm about my motherfucking thread
Its your truly I still roll with the squad
Ain't talkin your points outta thing feelin your bars
They want to do me but heck I'm already on it
I ain't gotta hit the car I got it already own it
Nigga you ain't they say this song is to cold
The same thing you heard before your mug got hit with a bottle
I gets to it I'm out there smokin on purple
Posted up getting money with my nigga from the circle
Homeboy believe it I keep some sacks on my hand
I'm posted up with my gat in my pants motherfucker I ain't playin

Whatchu lookin at nigga step the fuck back
We on the post your in our space don't step so close
They know I'm ownin the game cause I stay grippin the grain
I'm riding dirty on probation but I'll scrap with no things
So whatchu lookin at nigga whatchu lookin at
So whatchu lookin at nigga whatchu lookin at
So whatchu lookin at nigga step the fuck back
So whatchu lookin at nigga step the fuck back

It's something new for them lets clean up off his plate
Let's make a move on them no time to hesitate
So ride the groove on them ain't no more time to wait
Ain't no more room for them ain't nothing to debate
Just let them fight for it something they never heard
We keep it fight for them precise with every word
I'm screamin at it nigga just watch where I swerve
We runnin havoc nigga bangin on every curve
We hit it raw on them real make calling off air
We making blood on the niggas don't want to take it there
A-t-l running things you goobers stack your chains
Moe back off in this thing jump off put in the game
You might also like
We are known for being sold in a click foolish as mine
Cigarillo bustin choppin hoes down the line
Hating if you like us still the sun gone shine
Add a coupe the feature your request goes rewind
Like play action we stay ahead of the game
Runnin through your whole league and still a catch the grain
Cause this that real shit that make you act a fool
Where you straighten out that nigga and tell that bitch be cool
It's J-Bo shit nigga you already know
We shake them off and keep on rolling it begin to show
And sip good nigga I wish you would
I'm slidin with about 50 niggas straight up dead out the hood
