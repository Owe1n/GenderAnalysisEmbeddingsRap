BLACKJACK Lyrics
I just bought a new grill (Yah)
Shining like a new whip (True)
Adam got a new drip (Shit)
I'm a nappy-headed black lil' cool kid (Ah)
Yeah, I stack that, make that, break that, take that
Got a hundred ways I can flip that, get back
All up in the money just to get back
Bitch, back up, know you probably need a Tic Tac
It's that— (Hunh)
Bitch, you frontin' on me (Yo)
Why you wanna act like this? (Why?)
Rollie on my wrist so she wanna have kids (True)
Cuffs on my wrist so the cops don't trip
I—I'm too fly to fight (Yup)
Can't afford my price (No)
This a white tee (Clean)
Bitch, bite me (Hey)

I'm on a high (I'm on a high)
They on the low (They on the low)
You killin' my vibe (Killin' it)
Get out my zone (Get out my zone)
Said, I'm on a high (I'm on a high)
They on the low (You on the low)
You killin' my vibe (Killin' it)
Get out my zone (Get out my zone, bitch)

I'm the best in the groupchat (True)
My niggas won't admit that (No)
31 hoes in my FaceTime
And I'm the one to hoop that (Yee)
Rockin' and rollin' like Jack Black (Yoo)
Schoolin' you niggas like Jack Black (Yah)
How could you not like Jack Black? (How?)
I put that on my mama nigga, no cap (Huh)
Look, I hand it to Yos (Hey), he hand it to Jon (He do)
Shawty wanna fuck for a picture
Bi—Bitch, this ain't a Groupon (No)
This that CLBN (True)
Go ahead, bump it with mom (Do)
Said she want a spot on my list (Please)
I told her, "Go pray to your God" (I need to go to church)
Yeah, I dig that, flip that, make that, check back
When I wanna get it back? ASAP
It's that young nigga back, no six pack, fuck that
I'm too rich for the chit-chat, young, black
You might also like
I—I'm too fly to fight (Yup)
Can't afford my price (No)
This a white tee (Clean)
Bitch, bite me (Hey)

I'm on a high (I'm on a high)
They on the low (They on the low)
You killin' my vibe (Killin' it)
Get out my zone (Get out my zone)
Said, I'm on a high (I'm on a high)
They on the low (You on the low)
You killin' my vibe (Killin' it)
Get out my zone (Get out my zone, bitch)18Embed
