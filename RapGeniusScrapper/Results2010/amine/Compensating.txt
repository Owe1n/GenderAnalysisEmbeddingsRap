TranslationsEspañolCompensating Lyrics
Compensatin' for your feelings
And you know the feelin'
This is what you thought would heal it
But it makes you feel it
Tryin' things you thought would cheer it
But you grow to fear it
Times, they come and go like spirits (You good, T-Minus?)
I see these signs the clearest

And you, and you, and you know why (Yuh)
You've been fuckin' with me since I was a small fry (True)
And your ex-man (Yuh), that's my lil' guy (Yuh)
I know some niggas that'll kick 'em to the coast lines (True)
I'm a West Side nigga, we don't show signs (No)
You got some fake friends, they just toe lines (Yeah)
Text, I reply, baby, 'til my phone die (Yeah)
You know he lied if a nigga said he don't lie (Ayy)
I fucked up once again (Yeah)
And you know that I'm never too proud to beg (No)
It's hard to admit that I've made my bed (Yeah)
And you know I'ma always wish you the best (True)
Look, bitch, roll inside the Benz (Yeah)
I fucked up once and I got you bent (Uh-huh)
It's hard to admit that I've made my bed (Uh-huh)
But you know I'ma always wish you the best (Limbo)

Compensatin' for your feelings
And you know the feelin'
This is what you thought would heal it
But it makes you feel it
Tryin' things you thought would cheer it
But you grow to fear it
Times, they come and go like spirits
I see these signs the clearest

Bad, baby, from the back, baby (Let's go)
I hope her heart experiencing the crash, baby
I toast it up and pour it out the glass, baby (Pour)
I tripled up, I doubled up, I ranned it up, that fucked it up
The black and orange Aventador like Daffy Duck (Skrrt)
I swerve Mercedes Benz 'cause my credentials up (Yeah)
I told her I got my millions up, these racks, baby (Racks)
This song is hard as goosebumps, rash, baby (Racks)
I'm scorin' by the three, Steve Nash, baby (Yeah)
A couple million fee, all cash, baby (Yeah)
I eat all of your cheese and racks, baby (Ayy)
I eat a lil' cheese like a snack, baby (Yeah)
The orange and black seats, Daffy Duck (Ayy, ayy)
Five-leaf clover, better luck
Don't you ask, "Do I know you?" Never, yuh (Yeah, mmm)
I've been flyer than a pelican, yeah (Let's go)

This is what you thought would heal it
But it makes you feel it
Tryin' things you thought would cheer it

Times, they come and go like spirits
I see these signs the clearest

You've been givin' niggas surgical head (You've been)
You've been eatin' out a young nigga flesh (You've been)
You might win the key to my chest (You've been)
You might win, give a young nigga head (You've been)
You might win the key to my chest
You might win the key to my chest
You might win the key to my chest
You might win the key to my chest (Ayy)

I fucked up once again
And you know that I'm never too proud to beg

And you know I'ma always wish you the best
Look, bitch, roll inside the Benz
I fucked up once and I got you bent
It's hard to admit that I've made my bed
But you know I'ma always wish you the best (Yeah)17Embed
