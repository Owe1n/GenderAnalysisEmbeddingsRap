REEL IT IN Lyrics
Right now
Reel it in (Woo)
I got the bag, tell a friend (Hoo)
She got some ass, bring it in (Ayy)
Bitch, I'm the news, CNN, yeah
Reel it in
I got the bag, tell a friend (Hoo)
She got some ass, bring it in
Bitch, I'm the news, CNN, yeah (Hey)
Drippin'
Rollie got the tick-tock missin' (Shinin')
Bitch pimpin' (Ayy)
Broke niggas got me livid (Wow)
You Jordan or Pippen (True)
I'm Kobe, I'm never gon' dish it (Or miss it)
I'm distant as fuck and I ain't got the time to just kick it (Yeah)

I don't trust nobody 'cause I can't be fake
Frontin' ain't an option 'cause my soul can't change
And I'm tired of being humble, bitch, I feel no way
It's that young nigga shit, I might pull up to your bitch like

Reel it in (Woo)
I got the bag, tell a friend (Hoo)
She got some ass, bring it in (Ayy)
Bitch, I'm the news, CNN, yeah
Reel it in
I got the bag, tell a friend (Hoo)
She got some ass, bring it in
Bitch, I'm the news, CNN

Jesus Christ (Hallelujah)
I buy that shit before I even know the price (Hey!)
This thirteen K up on my finger, bitch, you right (True)
Them diamonds dancin', yeah, that boy be lookin' nice (Ayy)
I guess that's what you call that motherfuckin' ice
Got a thotiana, put her in designer (Ayy)
She Italiana, she a sorta-kinda (Ayy)
She Bj√∂rk cute, so she really fine (Ayy)
Just sorta weird, and she got some cake (True)
She gimme OPP for my ODB (Yeah), these APC, do your ABC's (Yeah)
I'm a young dread-head with anxiety (Damn)
And I love it when a bitch nigga tryin' me (True)
You might also like
I don't trust nobody 'cause I can't be fake
Frontin' ain't an option 'cause my soul can't change
And I'm tired of being humble, bitch, I feel no way
It's that young nigga shit, I might pull up to your bitch like

Reel it in (Woo)
I got the bag, tell a friend (Hoo)
She got some ass, bring it in (Ayy)
Bitch, I'm the news, CNN, yeah
Reel it in
I got the bag, tell a friend (Choo)
She got some ass, bring it in
Bitch, I'm the news, CNN, yeah31Embed
