Ooh, ooh, so in love
Ooh, so in love (Yeah)
Ooh, so in love (Yeah, yeah, uh)

You love Rihanna, but you ain't a savage (Nah, nah)
Don’t act like you perfect, you know that we both got some baggage (Yeah, yeah)
I was callin' your mama and you was callin' my accountants (Damn, damn)
You gave me headaches and I gave you too many chances (Yeah, yeah)
Look, tell me how the hell you got to Paris and Phuket (Uh)
Shawty too fine, but I bet she the bullet in roulette (Yeah)
I’m lookin' so clean, lookin' like Three Stacks in Gillette (Yeah)
She five for five online, she want a jet
Need some rent, bona fide
Broke my heart three times (Ooh)
Shawty hit a nigga with the peace sign (Ayy, ooh)
Wasn't with me since I had the Nissan (Ayy, ooh)
Blinded by your beauty, missin' these signs (Ayy, ooh)
Wish I had three eyes
Broke my heart three times (Ooh)
Shawty hit a nigga with the peace sign (Ayy, ooh)
Wasn't with me since I had the Nissan (Ayy, ooh)
One was okay (Okay, ayy), two wasn't cool (Yeah)
But that three was no way (Ooh)

Nobody said things would get easier (Easier, easier)
You gotta believe me
Nobody said things would get easier (Easier, easier)
You gotta believe me

I thought you loved me but shoutout Emani (Yeah, yeah)
You had you a baby, and now lil' mama’s a mommy (Yeah, uh, uh)
Shoutout to Lola, that coochie as wet as Dasani (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pussy so good, it should cost a Ferrari
And make me feel like I’m on molly (True)
Jesus, you need this, you was Kelly, I was Regis
Let's be honest, I been fuckin’ with you since my Air Forces had the creases (Woo)
Flaunt like a don, Yoko Ono, solo, strong
Stuck in limbo for how long? Please tell me where I belong
