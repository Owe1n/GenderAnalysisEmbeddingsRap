FML Lyrics
(Um, Reuel, stop playing)

Yeah, I see you got that new Mercedes
I might let you drive me crazy
Usually, I ain't the type to stay, uh
'Cause you could fall in and go psycho
Ain't no tellin' where this might go
But I'll take my chances either way
So come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up
(Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You look like somebody that could really hold it down (Down)
You look like somebody that would always stick around ('Round)
Got Latina in you, so I know you prolly crazy (Loco)
All my friends said, "Stay away," but that shit just don't phase me Uh, got a little bit of sassy, yeah I like that
You ain't take no shit, yeah, you fight back (You fight)
Never let a dude hit it on the first night (No)
I can't even sleep over 'til I wife that (Ahh)
All these bitches in my phone hit the boy, but
I've been curving everyone for you (Brr, brr, brr, brr)
Girl, I would give you every single password
All you gotta do is let me through, yeah

I'ma keep it honest (Honest)
I know that you got a past (Past)
I know you ain't perfect (Perfect)
But basic bitches never last (Last), yeah
I don't usually do this type of shit, so baby
Trust me when I tell you that I'm all about it (I'm all about it), yeah
Yeah, I might fall in love and let you fuck my life up
Just so I could go and write a song about it
You might also like
Yeah, I see you got that new Mercedes
I might let you drive me crazy
Usually, I ain't the type to stay (Type to stay, no)
'Cause you could fall in and go psycho
Ain't no tellin' where this might go
But I'll take my chances either way

So come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby (Yeah, yeah), fuck my life up (Ayy)
(Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Last man left you broken-hearted, let me treat you right (Right)
Shorty, if you need me, I can pull up any night (Night)
You just say the words, girl, I don't need a reason
Give me something more than just a lover on the weekend

I see you got that new Mercedes
I might let you drive me crazy
Usually, I ain't the type to stay (Type to stay, no)
'Cause you could fall in and go psycho
Ain't no tellin' where this might go
But I'll take my chances either way
So come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up
Come and fuck my life up, baby, fuck my life up

Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fuck my life up
Come and, come and, come and fuck my life up
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
