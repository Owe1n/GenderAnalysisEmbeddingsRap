Living Facts Lyrics
Take-take it easy word to 94 (Skrrr, Skrrr)
Out in Hollywood, I'm faded in the cut
I ain't rich yet but I made it out the mud
23 I'm living life just how I want
Yeah we, living facts now
Yeah we living facts now (Facts)

Everywhere I go, you know I'm with the team (With the team)
Vinny right there on the left he playing siege (Playing siege)
Out in LA everything ain't what it seems
But we, living facts now
Yeah we living facts now
1340 on me homie, I don't do no Bape (No)
Liquor and my debit card the only thing I chase (Yeah)
God won't let me flex yet, so I keep it in a safe, yeah
All my bros stay lifted like they pushin' up the plates
And you know (Yeah, yeah)
And you know (Ay, ay)
We on the road (Yeah, yeah)
On the road (Ay, Ay)

Riding with the top down, yeah
I'm with my shorty she gon' drop down, yeah
I'm on a high I'm feeling way up, yeah
I'm in that new fit looking laced up, yeah
We living facts, and I know some people prolly acting fake right now (Fake)
We could give a fuck 'bout what you say right now (Say)
Whole crew on the coast we surfing waves right now, yeah
We been living facts, that's everyday right now (Facts)

Maddy, Maddy, she hit me for the Addy
Lauren's parents out of town, so she gon' call me daddy
Used to fuck with Pattie (Yeah)
Now I'm back with with Bri though
If she do me foul, then I'ma drain it like a free throw (Swish, swish)
I can't lie lately I've been on some player shit (Yeah)
Eatin' sushi rolls then my shorty pay for it (Yeah)
Out in Cali with the same ones that I came up with (Squad)
No new friends naw, tell them all to take a hint
Whoa, in my zone
Bottle service up at OHM (OHM)
Bouncer kicked us out, we hit the Rocks with all the bros (Bros)
Mamma said to live it up so I'ma sip it slow
Living facts, that's the code, homie you already know
Yeah, you know (Yeah, yeah)
And you know (Ay, ay)
We on the road (Yeah, yeah)
On the road (Ay, ay)
You might also like
Riding with the top down, yeah
I'm with my shorty she gon' drop down, yeah
I'm on a high I'm feeling way up, yeah
I'm in that new fit looking laced up, yeah
We living facts, and I know some people probably acting fake right now (Fake)
We could give a fuck 'bout what you say right now (Say)
Whole crew on the coast we surfing waves right now, yeah
We've been living facts, it's everyday right now (Facts)2Embed
