Parted Ways Lyrics
I just seen you on the 'gram
I'm glad you're doing well
You still look cute as hell
But that don't mean I want you back
No, I ain't foolish now
I can't look stupid now

22, I got my mind right
I learned girls like you ain't my type
I had to let you go to see the real you
(you, you)
That shit, it opened up my eyesight, yeah
Spreading lies about me to like all of your friends
See you roll your eyes when I would mention the Benz
You told me get a back-up plan and watch what I spend
Now you living with your parents
Got them paying your rent
I tried to get you here, and get you motivated
But you ain't got no passion, you just smoking lately
Every single day, all you wanna do is lay
Girl there's nothing left to say
I'm just glad we parted ways
Yeah, I'm glad we parted ways
I just seen you on the 'gram
I'm glad you're doing well
You still look cute as hell
But that don't mean I want you back
No, I ain't foolish now
I can't look stupid now
Parted ways yeah, yeah we parted ways
Yeah we parted ways
Parted ways yeah, yeah we parted ways
Yeah we parted ways

Yeah we parted ways, what a season
I'm not searching for a love for no reason
Yeah, just for it to go to waste
I would rather drown or wrap a bag around my face
Aye, keep my mind straight
Your phone on vibrate, and Annihilate
Bullshit thrown up in my way
I remember when we used to chill at my place
Thought you were the one
Now I'm looking at you sideways
God damn man it's funny how things change
Back then I would've boughten you a wedding ring
Now it just seems strange, but I still feel the pain
You might also like
I just seen you on the 'gram
I'm glad you're doing well
You still look cute as hell
But that don't mean I want you back
No, I ain't foolish now
I can't look stupid now
Parted ways yeah, yeah we parted ways
Yeah we parted ways
Parted ways yeah, yeah we parted ways
Yeah we parted ways2Embed
