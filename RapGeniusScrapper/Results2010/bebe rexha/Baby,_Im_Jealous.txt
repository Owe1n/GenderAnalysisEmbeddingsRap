TranslationsEspañolPortuguêsBaby, I’m Jealous Lyrics
Baby, I'm jealous

Went from beautiful to ugly
'Cause insecurity told me you don't love me
All it takes is a girl above me
On your timeline to make me nothing

This is me, a woman in dichotomy
I love me until I don't
Baby, I'm jealous
Of the pictures that you like
Baby, I'm jealous
Of the girls with lighter eyes
Baby, I'm jealous (Ooh)
And I know that it ain't right
But I'm jealous, jealous (Haha)
The jealous kind

I'm jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly on a plate
Sunny side up, I got egg on my face
Waist trainer for a tinier waist
But I can't help it if I like the way food taste

This is me, a woman in dichotomy
I love me until I don't
My apologies for looking on your history
I'm trying to let it go

Baby, I'm jealous
Of the pictures that you like
Baby, I'm jealous
Of the girls with lighter eyes
Baby, I'm jealous (Ooh)
And I know that it ain't right
But I'm jealous, jealous
The jealous kind

That chick, can't be that chick
Baby, I'm a bad bitch
If he fiendin', he'll prolly get a catfish
Keep him dreamin' to pull up on a nap, shit
I don't even be askin' him, "Who that chick?"
Yuh-huh, who that chick? Nah
That's pitiful, that's so average, why?
Some women want men and some girls want bwahs
Tell lies until they buggin' and they pants on fire, uh
I stole ya man
He got freedom to chase what he likes
I know you're mad
But he ain't even worth none of your time
It's such a drag
I'm not being spiteful, but he's trash
Won't be the last
To let you know, but he gon' show you

Baby, I'm jealous
Of the pictures that you like
Baby, I'm jealous (Ooh)
Of the girls with lighter eyes
Baby, I'm jealous (Ooh, I'm jealous)
And I know that it ain't right (You lied to me)
But I'm jealous, jealous (Uh-uh)
The jealous kind (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm jealous of her (Yeah)
Need ya number (Ba-baby, I'm)
She doesn't love ya
Boy, lemme show ya (Baby, I'm jealous)
I'm jealous of her (I'm jealous, I'm jealous)
Need ya number (I'm jealous, I'm jealous, ba-baby, I'm)
She doesn't love ya (I'm jealous, I'm jealous)
Boy, lemme show ya (I'm jealous, baby, I'm jealous)32Embed
