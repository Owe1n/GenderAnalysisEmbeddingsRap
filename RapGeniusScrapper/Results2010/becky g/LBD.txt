TranslationsPortuguêsEspañolLBD Lyrics
Brrp, brrp

Every time you see me with my little black dress on
Oh, you need me
Say you want a freak some, I can see it
You wanna be grown, no, rated PG
Baby, you should know that I ain't easy

With my little black dress on
With my little black dress on
With my little black dress on
Little black dress on
I'll save the date like it's your birthday
You tell me you just want a piece of the cake (birthday cake)
I just might let you get some today (huh)
'Cause the way you been grinding on me
You got me feeling some type of way
I'm into all these moves

Plus this McQueen, it fits me real tight
I got your hands taking a ride on the wild side
Know what they say 'bout girls from these sides
You'll wanna risk it all

Every time you see me with my little black dress on
Oh, you need me
Say you want a freak some, I can see it
You wanna be grown, no, rated PG
Baby, you should know that I ain't easy

With my little black dress on
With my little black dress on
With my little black dress on
Little black dress on
You might also like
I know you wondering what's under here (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Sweet pineapples, just imagine that (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just a dirty little teaser (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Type of love to have you coming back (hold up)

Plus this McQueen, it fits me real tight
I got your hands taking a ride on the wild side
Know what they say 'bout girls from these sides
You'll wanna risk it all

Every time you see me with my little black dress on
Oh, you need me
Say you want a freak some, I can see it
You wanna be grown, no, rated PG
Baby, you should know that I ain't easy

Es mucha tentación, tú puedes ver pero no tocar
Usa tu imaginación, que nunca sabes que va a pasar
Acércate a mí un poquito mas, oh-oh-oh
Si te portas bien te lo voy a dar

Every time you see me with my little black dress on
Oh, you need me
Say you want a freak some, I can see it
You wanna be grown, no, rated PG
Baby, you should know that I ain't easy
With my little black dress on (my little brack dress on)
With my little black dress on (me gusta a ti)
With my little black dress on
Little black dress on (bow, bow)4Embed
