This is the Holy Moly Donut Shop, uh?
Say it with me, guys, Holy Moly Donut Shop
Holy Moly Donut Shop

Holy moly
40 leave him like a donut (Holy moly)
Pull up and shoot like Ginóbili (Ginóbili)
Can't wear the Rollie without the pollie (Rollie-pollie)
Holy moly
40 leave him like a donut (Holy moly)
Pull up and shoot like Ginóbili (Ginóbili)
Can't wear the Rollie without the pollie (Rollie-pollie)
Rollie-pollie, can't wear the Rollie without the pollie (Rollie-pollie)
Twin Glocks named Zack and Cody (Holy moly)
Party pooper just like Mr. Moseby (Ooh)
Do a mission in my Sprinter van (Sprintin')
Hop out, niggas sprintin' (Runnin')
Hit him in the back, rip through his stomach (Ugh)
Shoot the club up, I ain't tell her I was comin' (Ooh)
This ho hit and I ain't even have to punch in (Punch in)
Up the 23 like Jumpman ('Sup then?)
Just in case a nigga try to jump in (Jump in)
Jump in, jump in, jump in

Holy moly
40 leave him like a donut (Holy moly)
Pull up and shoot like Ginóbili (Ginóbili)
Can't wear the Rollie without the pollie (Rollie-pollie)
Holy moly
40 leave him like a donut (Holy moly)
Pull up and shoot like Ginóbili (Ginóbili, NLE)
Can't wear the Rollie without the pollie (Bitch, rollie-pollie)

Holy (Yeah), shit
Glock got a dick, I'ma piss on that bitch (Brr)
Put my gun to his lip like he kissin' that bitch (Bitch ass nigga)
Pop up at his house, I ain't sendin' no diss (Nope, knock-knock)
You childish, lil' nigga, I'm a grown-up (Big dawg)
Put this dick in her mouth like a donut (She eatin')
If a nigga want smoke, we gon' roll up, make him bite the dust (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Every time that I shoot, bitch, you know I'm not missin' (Brr)
Leave that boy dry like a Popeyes biscuit (Yeah)
Fucked up in the head, better keep your distance
Pull up and shoot like Andrew Wiggins
