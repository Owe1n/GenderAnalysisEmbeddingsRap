No Time For Sleep (Freestyle) Lyrics
Ain't got no time for sleep
With so much money on my mind, ain't got no time for me
Shorty call me all the time and say she tired of me
I know that I pop a lot of, and smoke a lot of weed
And I don't pay her any mind when I be countin' breesh
Baby, I'm busy on the road, I need some time to breathe
They had me locked up in the pens, doin' twenty-three
So I be stackin' Mr. Ben 'til he twenty feet
A lot of, a lot of Ms in my twenty-three's
Bitch, .45 on my waist, I'm with my ven aquí
Bitch, .45 on my waist, don't gotta turn the key
Bitch, .45 on my waist, I'm in my Bentley Jeep
Bitch, finna fire on them niggas, they was twenty-three
If I put that iron on them niggas, they remеmber me
If you heard wе slidin' on them niggas, they make memories
If I put that iron on them niggas, they remember me
If you heard we slidin' on them niggas, they make memories
Chopper, chopper, brr, brand new chopper out to tear bodies

Gave my bro a dub, we been coadie since the sandbox

Huh, so you say it's love, then why your hands up?
