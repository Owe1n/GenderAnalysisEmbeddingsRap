Let’s Get It (Remix) Lyrics
Let's get it, nigga, let's get it
If you about this money, let's get it
Boss up

I got the drugs and I got a plug, they checking our tickets
Bitches they stare at my pants and be like "Boy what’s in them britches?"
Keep red bottoms on the bottom of my shoe, they like how we kick it
I had a boss talk with my crew, and I told them niggas let’s get it
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it
I got the drugs and I got a plug, they checking our tickets
I had a boss talk with my crew and I told them niggas let's get it
I'm in a boat, yeah, I’m in a boat, yeah, I'm in a boat
I'm cooking up blow, I'm cooking up blow, I'm cooking up blow
A half a brick for my body before I come to your show
A half of brick or better before you come to my door
Let's get it, she know I'm a D-boy
Shinin', cuttin' it, Bruce Leroy
My Forgis, my Forgis, put the baby on her face
Fucking her bush, this be the closed casket
Go get me a coffin, let's get it, let's get it, let’s get it
These bitches, they cook naked, showing they ass and titties
And I know that she with it
And before I said something, she said let's get it

I got the drugs and I got a plug, they checking our tickets
Bitches they stare at my pants and be like "Boy what’s in them britches?"
Keep red bottoms on the bottom of my shoe, they like how we kick it
I had a boss talk with my crew, and I told them niggas let’s get it
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it
I got the drugs and I got a plug, they checking our tickets
I had a boss talk with my crew and I told them niggas let's get it

All of my bitches, they know what it is, they know we gon' get it (Get it)
I'll probably just get the head, she ain’t got no ass or titties (Ooh yeah)
Smoking a joint while she sucking me off, blow the smoke in her face (Oh yeah)
Bust a nut, then I got to go, nigga got money to make
Money be coming and so do these bitches (Yeah)
These niggas wearing fake Rollies, man I hear the shit ticking
The OG to the kush, we got it (Got it)
I flew in the air, and I fucked me a bitch that be working at Follies (Oh yeah)
Told her pull up and let’s get it (Let's get it)
Girl I’m not your man, I’m your nigga (No, no)
Don’t fuck around with the fuck around
I give her the business
You might also like
I got the drugs and I got a plug, they checking our tickets
Bitches they stare at my pants and be like "Boy what’s in them britches?"
Keep red bottoms on the bottom of my shoe, they like how we kick it
I had a boss talk with my crew, and I told them niggas let’s get it
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it
I got the drugs and I got a plug, they checking our tickets
I had a boss talk with my crew and I told them niggas let's get it

Leave out the club, I’m smoking on drugs, a couple of bitches
See that new nine eleven, you don’t own the color, that’s Wiz’s
One in my bed, and one on my line, like I’m going fishing
Kush in my lungs, I smoke when I want, they want me for Christmas
Rolling my weed, she cook and she clean, she doing my dishes
Came over, she pulled my dick out, then she started blowing it kisses
Sprayed it all over her face, now the bitch watching my children
Probably be in outer space, standing on all of these millions
Let’s get it niggas
Ass fat but her titties bigger
Bitch you from the 90’s
I’m tryna put some dick up in your life, girl let’s get it, ho!41Embed
