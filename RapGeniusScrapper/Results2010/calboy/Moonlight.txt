Moonlight Lyrics
Ah, bitch, we criminal smooth
Y-Y-Y-Yung Lan on the track
And I hang with the mob, ahaha
You know I'm with the mob
Bitch, we criminal smooth
Hundred bands for a kilo, nigga
Ayy, ayy

And it ain't nothin' new, on the grind for the loot
And I hang with the mob, bitch, we criminal smooth
Bitch, I gave you my heart, can you tell me the truth?
Boy, you better think smart 'cause you know what we do
Yeah, they know how we move, right? Girl, they sneak, better move right
We still baggin' them tools, right? My niggas be wolves in the moonlight
Drop dead, we gon' hit 'em, don't start, we gon' hit 'em
Trap hard in the kitchen, broken heart with no feelings
And I know all these niggas lames and these bitches fu, they be changin'
I know niggas think it's sweet, nigga, we can link, get it bangin'
If I blow, let these bullets burn, chopper sing like it's Usher Raymond
And I roll with some real killers and some real drillers, know they dangerous, tweakin', we make it, we famous
All this money got 'em upset, ayy, hundred niggas want me dead, ayy
Extended my mag, ayy, run up on me, you get whacked
Yeah, I roll with the warriors, we run through the city
Yeah, we finna slide and we finna slide, ain't leavin' no witness
Yeah, ayy, bro in the kitchen, he whippin' the Whitney
I got some money, you don't know the feelin'
Ayy, thirty on me, make a fuck nigga get back
Yeah, get back, yeah, hop in the foreign and zig-zag

And it ain't nothin' new, on the grind for the loot
And I hang with the mob, bitch, we criminal smooth
Bitch, I gave you my heart, can you tell me the truth?
Boy, you better think smart 'cause you know what we do
Yeah, they know how we move, right? Girl, they sneak, better move right
We still baggin' them tools, right? My niggas be wolves in the moonlight
Drop dead, we gon' hit 'em, don't start, we gon' hit 'em
Trap hard in the kitchen, broken heart with no feelingsYou might also like1Embed
