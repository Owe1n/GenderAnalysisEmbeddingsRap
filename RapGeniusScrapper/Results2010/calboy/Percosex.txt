Percosex Lyrics
JD On Tha Track (Oh)
LeeBoy on the track
Oh
Sheesh, yeah, ayy

Niggas wanna tweak with me, I ain't fill my .30 yet (My .30 yet)
It’s just me, my bad lil’ bitch and Percocet (We off perc)
Shawty wanna freak on me, said she want percosex (Said she want percosex, sheesh)
Shawty wanna freak on me, said she want percosex (Hey)
Shawty wanna suck up my energy (Ayy)
These bitches remember me
Step in the trap, I got plenty keys
I got some shit that go ten a piece (Sheesh, sheesh)
Don’t fuck with these niggas, ain't kin to me
I know some niggas gon' kill for me
Shawty wanna catch a lil’ feel for me
I give a fuck if you feel for me (Hey, hey)
I get a new spoiler I got some diamonds, they drippin’ like water
I’m in the trap with the pots and the water
I made some millions, I trapped a lil' harder (Ayy)
I just might let it blow, fuckin’ with me, then he dead fo’ sho’
I got the keys, I let it snow
I’m on the block with the deads, you know
I sip on the drink and I’m leanin’
Baby, you know what you mean for me
She suck on that dick and get lean for free
We pull up on shorty with beams and things
Lil’ baby, I’m dripping, got wings and things
And I got some problems, I’ve seen some things
And I lost some members, it's long live the kings
Bitch I’m off a jigga, I fuck with the bean (Hey, hey)

Niggas wanna tweak with me, I ain't fill my .30 yet (My .30 yet)
It’s just me, my bad lil’ bitch and Percocet (We off perc)
Shawty wanna freak on me, said she want percosex (Said she want percosex, sheesh)
Shawty wanna freak on me, said she want percosex (Hey)
Shawty wanna suck up my energy (Ayy)
These bitches remember me
Step in the trap, I got plenty keys
I got some shit that go ten a piece (Sheesh, sheesh)
Don’t fuck with these niggas, ain't kin to me
I know some niggas gon' kill for me
Shawty wanna catch a lil’ feel for me
I give a fuck if you feel for me (Sheesh, sheesh)You might also like3Embed
