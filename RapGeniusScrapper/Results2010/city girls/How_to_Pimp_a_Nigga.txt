How to Pimp a Nigga Lyrics
All my bad ass bitches, pay attention (attention)
These broke ass, fraudulent ass niggas off limits (damn right)
It's time to wake up (up), it's time to go and get it (period)
Tricking these niggas everyday, is a mission, listen! (hell, yeah)
I'ma show you bitches how to pimp a nigga (damn right)
I-I'ma show you bitches how to pimp a nigga (get that money)
I'ma show you bitches how to pimp a nigga
Make him think you love him, take his money, then you dip on niggas

Rule one, never ever ever fall in love with some dick that you meet up in the club (never)
Rule two, remember that a nigga chose you (yup), now you got him where you want him at, boo
Tell him first round, daddy, water on me (me)
Make a nigga feel like a motherfucking P (boss)
He'll come to understand, that the pussy ain't free (nah)
Got that quality control, good pussy ain't cheap (QC)
Niggas love when you talk to 'em ratchet
If he got a check then his fantasy can happen
In a room full of hoes, you don't be the madame
Got the blueprint to a niggas pocket and his pay, ow!
All my bad ass bitches, pay attention (attention)
These broke ass, fraudulent ass niggas off limits (damn right)
It's time to wake up (up), it's time to go and get it (period)
Tricking these niggas everyday, is a mission, listen! (hell yeah)
I'ma show you bitches how to pimp a nigga (damn right)
I-I'ma show you bitches how to pimp a nigga (get that money)
I'ma show you bitches how to pimp a nigga (yeah)
Make him think you love him, take his money, then you dip on niggas

Pimping ain't easy, but pussy ain't free (at all)
You will never go broke, just listen to me (pay attention)
You gotta let these niggas know what you need (money)
House, cars, credit cards, don't forget the keys (yeah)
Get it, how you live
Tell that nigga what he want, so he can pay your bills (yup)
All these niggas fake, none of these niggas real (nah)
So don't let a nigga fuck, just let him touch it a lil', ow!
Why you looking sad hoe? (uh)
Don't you know these niggas looking for a bad hoe (bad bitch)
Tighten up, 'fore you end up like the last hoe
City Girls leaving all these niggas dead broke, period!

All my bad ass bitches, pay attention (attention)
These broke ass, fraudulent ass niggas off limits (damn right)
It's time to wake up (up), it's time to go and get it (period)
Tricking these niggas everyday, is a mission, listen! (hell yeah)
I'ma show you bitches how to pimp a nigga (damn right)
I-I'ma show you bitches how to pimp a nigga (get that money)
I'ma show you bitches how to pimp a nigga (yeah)
Make him think you love him, take his money, then you dip on niggas
