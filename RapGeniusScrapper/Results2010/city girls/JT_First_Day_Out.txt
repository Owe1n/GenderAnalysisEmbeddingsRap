JT First Day Out Lyrics
J.T., I-I'm ready for you to come home, man
Okay, Pee
I remember when you first, like, went off on us about making music
We turned out made two whole, like, albums
You know what I'm sayin'?
You done turned hoodrats into some superstars, man
For real, hahahaha

When I was countin' down, these bitches counted me out (Yeah)
Now I'm back, I got 'em shocked, these bitches droppin' they mouth (Mouth)
Lil' Runaway, my friend mama helped me out
I don't give a fuck about no bed, I'll sleep on the couch (Couch)
Now I'm up
But I can write a book about the rainy days (Facts)
I don't gotta throw shade to get a fanbase
I been a real bitch way before the fed case (Yeah)
Yung Miami held me down, that's a bitch ace (Period)
And if a bitch try her, it's a cold case
Get yo ass snatched up like my new waist (Yeah)
Pulled in and out of prison like a drive-thru
Audemars waitin' on me 'cause the time flew (Ice)
I went from boots to khakis to Louis tennis shoes
Sendin' prayers to my people sittin' in the SHU
The blogs, they made me mad, they made me motivated
Yeah, I left the chain gang, bitch, I graduated
Been the most important bitch, yeah, I'm celebrated (Yeah)
Lil' baldhead bitch, still the most hated (Most hated)
Bitch, I'm right on time for the season change (Yeah)
Y'all hoes real salty, bitch, it's seasons change (Yeah)
Might make my side nigga cop me a Range
And put it up for my bitch, she got the best brain
Pull up by myself, Miss Pearly don't need no army, bitch (Yeah)
I ain't got no love for these niggas, I ain't Barney, bitch
Embarrass a bitch on stage, I'm on some Maury shit
Any bitch in my way, you gon' be sorry, bitch
I wish I would let one of you hoes try me
I'll be back in khakis, blue shoes, walkin' through R&D
How y'all gon' end City Girls when y'all ain't half of me?
Don't play with Yung Miami, ho, that's the other half of me
Had the whole world waitin' on me like I'm a virgin
So it's time to pop this cherry (This cherry), get this pussy workin' (Ayy)
New Rolls Royce, in the back it was a Birkin
Now that City Girls shit, bitch, that's for certain (Period)
This really my first day out, I ain't wait a day
Ate that time up like it's cake, JT Anna Mae
Two bad bitches and they kissin' in the Wraith
Kissin'-kissin' in the Wraith
Kissin'-kissin' in the Wraith
Went in the same day Drake dropped "In My Feelings"
I was in prison on my bunk, really in my feelings (Facts)
Now I'm back to the millions, bitches in they feelings
I was in grays playing spades, Miami making children
But we ain't killin' blessings just to please the public (Nah)
So when y'all say, "City Girls over," just change the subject (How you know?)
Y'all hoes always bringing up old shit (Damn)
Go get a sugar daddy, suck a old dick (Get some old dick)
Bitches get exposed everyday
But I'm from Dade, I'ma do it anyway (I don't care)
If I wasn't who I was, they wouldn't fuck with me
But I am who I am, and y'all can't fuck with me (Yeah)
Went platinum on my bunk, sis can't come for me (What's up?)
Like a ten-minute move, you better run for me
I did my time like a G
Man, motherfuck the B-O-P (Man, fuck the B-O-P)
Man, motherfuck L-P (Fuck 'em)
I keep some fours that'll match your I.D
Y'all hoes want smoke, bring a match (Match, let's go)
Left prison with a pimple, not a scratch (Scratch)
Point, blank, period, won't see me back
Unless I'm pullin' up just to see Max (Ow)
Oh, and one more thing before I go
How y'all gon say a made bitch was pregnant from a C.O.?
I don't fuck with cops or blockers, you bitches slow
Stop with all the rumors, and tell your nigga I'm home
And it's on
Period!
