Tighten Up Lyrics
Huh, messy hoes better wipe it up
Bitch, don’t make me put my wig in a rubber band
Slap a bitch down, with the fuck shit
Y’all hoes better tighten up (tighten up, huh)
Y’all hoes better tighten up

I’m already gooking, on my period, PMS'ing
My nigga fucking on me, and I’m stressing (damn)
Haters tryna knock me for the shit that I’m blessed with, period!
You got a problem, hoe, address it (get there)
Real bitches to the square
I’m speaking for the boss bitches
And not you hoes that be fucking for hair
But my dog I'll slide, if it’s a lick I'll drive, to a nigga I'll lie!
Sleepy hoes better wake up!
And get your motherfucking cake up
Or get smoked like a Grape Dutch
If you fucking for a stack, bitch, it ain’t much (nothin')
It’s a drought ‘round here, pussy went up (facts)
Now my feelings on E, I need to fill up
A new Benz, just to sit up
Condo on a beach just to kick up (kick up)
After the check, we can split up

I’m already gooking, on my period, PMS'ing
My nigga fucking on me, and I’m stressing
Haters tryna knock me for the shit that I’m blessed with, period!
You got a problem, hoe, address it

My nigga acting crazy, (nigga, what's up)
I’m ‘bout to get rid of his baby
His mama acting shady, his sister tryna spray me (what)
His homeboys wanna fuck me
And every bitch in the hood wanna fuck on him, because me (facts)
I ain’t got time for these niggas, cause these niggas ain’t nothin'
I ain’t tryna figure out, who he sucking and fucking
Bitch, I got other shit to stress about (stress about)
My bills late, money running out
Pull up, them stores, bitch, are running out
I gotta get it by any means (period)
And keep Miami close, cause these other hoes only switch teams
When I’m in the field, just know I play for keeps
And keep my grass cut, so these bitches won’t creep
You might also like
I’m already gooking, on my period, PMS'ing
My nigga fucking on me, and I’m stressing
Haters tryna knock me for the shit that I’m blessed with, period!
You got a problem, hoe, address it1Embed
