Ah, ah-ah, C-I-T-Y
Ah, ah-ah, C-I-T-Y
Ah, ah-ah, C-I-T-Y
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

It's time for the twerkulator
It's time for the twerkulator
I'ma shake what my mama gave me
I'ma shake my money-maker
It's time for the twerkulator
It's time for the twerkulator
It's time for the twerkulator
It's time for the twerkulator (Ayy)
JT, I'm fly wit' it (I'm fly)
C-I-T-Y wit' it (City Girls)
Right cheek, left cheek wit' it (Woo)
Fun size, on fleek wit' it (Uh)
Slim thick, petite wit' it (I'm bad)
G-wag with the key missing (Skrr)
One time for my freak bitches (Ayy, ayy)
After hour, no sleep bitches (Where y'all at?)
When I get my freak on
They throwin' money like Meech home (B.M.F.)
When I do my dance (Ayy)
Money fight, these niggas throwin' bands (Money fight)
JT, I ain't playin' (I ain't playin')
Lil' bitch, I'on' want your man (Fuck that nigga)
But these rich niggas throwin' paper
Now it's time for the twerkulator (Back that ass up)

It's time for the twerkulator
It's time for the twerkulator
I'ma shake what my mama gave me
I'ma shake my money-maker
It's time for the twerkulator
It's time for the twerkulator
It's time for the twerkulator
It's time for the twerkulator

Pop that pussy on some Luke shit
Fuck all of that cute shit
Break it down for that loot, bitch (Break it down)
Uh, twerk-twerkulate

At the after hours, we workin' late (Ayy)
Bad bitches on the paper chase
