Me U & Hennessy Lyrics
Can we stay home tonight?
Try something new tonight?
This drink got me feelin' right
I'm 'bout to lose my mind
You, me, and Hennessy, look what you did to me
Fuckin' so crazy, you twirlin' and spinnin' me
My head keep on spinnin', my legs keep on shakin'
But my head keep on spinnin'
I'm out of my mind, let's keep on sippin'
Let's make some babies and make it official
I feel you inside, no better feelin'
I throw it back, and you catch my driftin'
You shiftin' inside you got me screamin'
You got me yellin' out yo name, ooh, I need you
You kiss on my thighs and then you eat it
Pause for a minute, then I let you beat it
I lovin' this ride, smooth like a Bimmer
Smooth like that Henny, this what happens when we drinkin'
I'm not gonna lie, you got me speechless
Got 69, more than 25 reasons
Me, Hennessy, and you
Me, Hennessy, and you
Me, Hennessy, and you
Me, Hennessy, and you

You, me, and Hennessy, look what you did to me
I say my head keep on spinnin'
Me, Hennessy, and you
Ayy, ayy, this what happens when we drinkin'
Me, Hennessy, and you
Me, Hennessy, and youYou might also like176Embed
