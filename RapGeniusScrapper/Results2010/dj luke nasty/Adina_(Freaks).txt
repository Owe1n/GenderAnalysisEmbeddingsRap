Adina (Freaks) Lyrics
She love that rough sex, tough sex
That whipped cream, handcuff sex
She ain't had it in a minute so she upset
I gave her dope dick, fuck a drug test
Yup, so what's your favorite position?
Matter of fact, I love a woman who can play her position
You looking, you looking tense, let me stand in attention
We started in the whip and made our way to the kitchen
Beep beep, who got the keys to my Jeep?
I was in the backseat with a freak
Who you know who could really really do it like me?
Drop it down low, baby, do it like 
Go, girl, it's your birthday
Fuck them hating assholes at your work place
We be on that Don Julio thirsty
So I'll be a good girl in the first place

'Cause I will be a freak until the day, until the dawn
And we getting (romp romp) all through the night to the early morn'
Come on now, I'll take you around the way on a gangsta lean
'Cause we getting (romp romp) any time of day, it's all good for me
I need a lady in the streets, but a freak in the sheets, aye

She love her hair pulled and her ass smacked
Yeah, come her, baby, let me grab that
She threw it back like "nigga, you could have that"

Aye, now what it taste like?
Yeah, she roll that dick with no break lights

So go, girl, it's your birthday
Fuck them hating assholes at your work place
We be on that Don Julio thirsty
So I'll be a good girl in the first place

'Cause I will be a freak until the day, until the dawn
And we getting (romp romp) all through the night to the early morn'
Come on now, I'll take you around the way on a gangsta lean
'Cause we getting (romp romp) any time of day, it's all good for me
I need a lady in the streets, but a freak in the sheets, aye

Aye, I got that drink in my system
And somebody gon' be my victim

And somebody gon' be my victim, aye

I know the bay gon' make a hit out of this

'Cause I will be a freak until the day, until the dawn
And we getting (romp romp) all through the night to the early morn'
Come on now, I'll take you around the way on a gangsta lean
'Cause we getting (romp romp) any time of day, it's all good for me
I need a lady in the streets, but a freak in the sheets, ayeEmbed
