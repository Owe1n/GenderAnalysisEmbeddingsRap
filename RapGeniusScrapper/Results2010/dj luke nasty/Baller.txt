Baller Lyrics
Wanna be a baller, shot caller
Twenty-inch blades on the Impala
Call her, gettin' laid tonight
Got a blunt rolled up, gettin' blazed tonight
I hit the highway, gettin' money the fly way
I hit the highway, gettin' money the fly way

Wait, been in H-Town about a week
Got inspired up in spot with a freak
On that drank so you know a nigga geeked (geek)
Tongue so long that she think a nigga Greek
I be gettin' money every day of the week
Pull up in that old school, swingers on the feets
Swingin’ and you know I got them speakers bangin’
Let me hear you sing it
Wanna be a baller, shot caller
Twenty-inch blades on the Impala
Call her, gettin' laid tonight
Got a blunt rolled up, gettin' blazed tonight
I hit the highway, gettin' money the fly way
I hit the highway, gettin' money the fly way

Ayy, just touched down, we in Dallas
You know I heard Park Ave got the baddest
Somebody tell CJ I need the platter
I got the smoke in the club 'cause it's a habit
Pull off the style, we do the dash (do the dash)
Girl with the curves, I might crash (might crash)
Girl what you heard? I'm just asking (What you heard?)
She said "You know what you heard, you look nasty"
We gettin' high like a rasta
And I got a high on my roster
Said she in school to be a lawyer, she coulda been a doctor
She just-

Wanna be a baller, shot caller
Twenty inch blades on the Impala
Call her, gettin' laid tonight
Got a blunt rolled up, gettin' blazed tonight
I hit the highway, gettin' money the fly way
I hit the highway, gettin' money the fly wayYou might also likeEmbed
