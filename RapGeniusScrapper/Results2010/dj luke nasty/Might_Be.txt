Might Be Lyrics
Wait
3, ayy
(Run for cover)

I got a feeling that you might be (High)
Do I turn you on?
You can tell me if I'm wrong
Girl, I think you might be (High)
And she don't even smoke
But she swear I got that dope dick
Love it when I fuck her and she's (High)
Ayy, high sex is the best sex
Whenever she stressed
She just want to get (high)
Well, get high, baby
Get high, baby
Is you rolling? I might be
You the shit, you the sugar, honey, iced tea
What I got to hint for?
You know I'm a nympho
On my Marshawn Lynch
You know what I'm here for (Ayy)
Riding through the city and get (High)
Take you to the crib and have one hell of a night
It's ironic cause we on cloud (High)
Girl, make up your mind
Is you mine or you mine?
Ayy, Henny what I'm drinking, she got Remy in her cup
She break down the weed, I break down the dutch
Body like J'lo after (High) she had enough
She caught contact, now she tryna fuck

I got a feeling that you might be (High)
Do I turn you on?
You can tell me if I'm wrong
Girl, I think you might be (High)
And she don't even smoke
But she swear I got that dope dick
Love it when I fuck her and she's (high)
Ayy, high sex is the best sex
Whenever she stressed
She just want to get (High)
Well, get high, baby
Get high, baby
You might also like
Okay, she told me she ain't never been (High)
Baby, the weed lit, let me take you on this trip
Just don't blow my (High)
But you know what you can blow
Let me teach you how to roll
So you can face one and get (High)
Now that girl hungry
She done went and got the Munchies
I just want some head and get (High)
Is that too much to ask?
Let me pour you up a glass
So you can get drunk and get (High)
Slide her panties to the side
Now she wanna ride
She on top and she said its too (High)
Aye, just take it slow baby and let me take control

I got a feeling that you might be (high)
Do I turn you on?
You can tell me if I'm wrong
Girl, I think you might be (High)
And she don't even smoke
But she swear I got that dope dick
Love it when I fuck her and she's (High)
Aye, high sex is the best sex
Whenever she stressed
She just want to get (High)
Well, get high, baby
Get high, baby
(High)
(High)
