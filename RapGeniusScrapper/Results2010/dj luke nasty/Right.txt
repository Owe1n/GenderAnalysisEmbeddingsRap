Right LyricsWait, 3

What's the move for the night?
What's the move for the night?
What's the move for the night?
We could drink all night, we could smoke all night
We could fuck all night
Girl if that's wrong I don't wanna be right, girl if that's wrong I don't wanna be right

Uh, baby tell me what you like, I'll put that on ice, that dress look nice, (whoa) that dress fit tight
How this wrong, but it feels so right?
We on Patron and the pills all night
Baby tell me what you need, baby tell me you a freak
I'll make that drop with the tank on E, make her sex when she blank on me
Kush so strong got a dank on me, say she wanna go but she ain't going to leave, why?
I give her good D now it’s 3rd and 15
What's the move for the night?
What's the move for the night?
What's the move for the night?
We could drink all night, we could smoke all night
We could fuck all night
Girl if that's wrong I don't wanna be right, girl if that's wrong I don't wanna be right

Uh, she was the right person at the wrong time
Too many missed calls and my phone died, shit
I started believing my own lies, them long talks them long rides, feeling weak with that strong pride
And that's going to be the death of us, let's make right whatever left of us
Don't let the past get the best of us, back when me and tub use to catch the bus
You was all I think ‘bout, so I reach out
Then she text me back like “Nigga where you at? You know I'm trying to leap out.”

What's the move for the night?
What's the move for the night?
What's the move for the night?
We could drink all night, we could smoke all night
We could fuck all night
Girl if that's wrong I don't wanna be right, girl if that's wrong I don't wanna be rightYou might also likeEmbed
