Hungry Lyrics
(Hungry, hungry) This special
(Hungry) The Biggest
(Hungry, Hungry) Global
(Hungry, Hungry) Huh, yeah
(Hungry, Hungry) Woo, yeah
(Hungry, Hungry) Mhm, yeah
(Hungry, Hungry) Mhm, yeah

To say it's complicated, understatement of the year (Yeah)
Well maybe conflict made it the new flavor in your ear (Yeah)
They know that I'm a problem, that's why everybody scared (Scare)
Whatever doesn't kill you, can make you an ill-ionaire, yeah
Uh, just turn the headphones up or make the windows roll up
I make they hands go up
When I show up and I blow it 'til I'm full up, wait, hold up
Girl up in the mirror, uh, only one I fear-a, uh
You say you the realest, I told you I'm the illest
Sick, sick, mmm
Hungry, starving, mhm
Not thirsty, m-m-mm, just hungry
Ambitious, still hungry
Still hungry

Woot, I'm moonwalking on marble floors (Exclude yourself)
Rick Ross, I'm just drippin' sauce (Huh)
Bitches see me and they all just wave (Boss)
Rolls Royce and we call this Wraith (Woo)
I fuck up money like I'm Escobar
Ballin', ballin', Kobe Bryant, that boy livin’ large
No room for medium, that means you thinkin' small
Ferrari, Fergie, switchin’ gears, she rockin' with a boss (Boss)
I close my eyes, I must be telepathic (Haha)
Look over haters, tripling my assets (Boss)
It takes courage to accomplish these things
Fergie's my queen, I'm the king, now come kiss on our rings

Sick, sick, mmm
Hungry
El Chapo
Starving
Rinzel
Mhm, not thirsty, m-m-mm, just hungry
Ferrari Fergie
Ambitious, still hungry
Still hungryYou might also like11Embed
