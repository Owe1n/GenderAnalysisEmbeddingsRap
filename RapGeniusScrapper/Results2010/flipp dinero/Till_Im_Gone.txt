Till I’m Gone Lyrics
Yeah (Yeah)
Oh, yeah
Young hitta on the block, I was trappin'
Young hitta on the block, I was trappin'
Young nigga on the block, I was trappin'

Ayy, young nigga on the block, I was trappin'
Different type of nigga, I was never with the actin'
Glizzy on my hip, and I ain't tryna make it happen
Niggas always talkin', but I'm focused on the action
When they come the money, shit, it turn you to a savage
When they come the money, nigga say you switched from average
Focused what I'm livin', I can't switch up what the bag did
Focused what I'm livin', rockin' foreign shit, Italian
What you know 'bout struggle? Flippin' words and make it happen
Stuck up on the block, I had my brothers with me trappin'
Niggas tried to hate and said I couldn't make it happen
Now I'm gettin' money, fill the duffel with the racks, and
Now I'm gettin' money, fill the duffel, let the racks build
Work until I get it, always knew I make it happen
Work until I get it, I'm a guala, I be trappin'
Tell 'em we the best and I'ma live it like a captain, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Grind 'til I'm gone, yeah
Hood I put on, yeah
This weed is so strong, yeah
I grind 'til I'm gone, yeah
Grind 'til I'm gone, yeah
My hood I put on, yeah
This weed is so strong, yeah
I grind 'til I'm gone, yeah

Young nigga on the block, I was trappin'
Tryna stack this money, man, I had to make it happen
Flippin' all this work, I had to re-up, make the bag flip
Smokin' all this dope, to make me ease up off that action
When it come to money, shit it turn them to a savage
When it come to money, separated from the average
Tryna live it lovely, but I'm caught up in this trappin'
Bimmer, push to start, my diamonds hittin' while I'm passin'
Smokin' all this dope, it got me thinkin', "How I land here?"
I ain't never love, 'cause honestly, I never played fair
All up through the struggles, honestly, I had to stay clear
Why you hatin' on me in my hood? I cannot stay there
Tryna live a lovely life, I live it, have sustain there
Thousands all up on me, plottin' millions, seen the safe there
Money all I want, and for that green you see I raced there
Life I live is lovely, for this green you see I'm chasin', yeah

Grind 'til I'm gone, yeah
Hood I put on, yeah
This weed is so strong, yeah
I grind 'til I'm gone, yeah
Grind 'til I'm gone, yeah
My hood I put on, yeah
This weed is so strong, yeah
I grind 'til I'm gone, yeah

I shared so much tears inside, but I ain't ever cry, though
We on the VIP side, we got a hundred bottles
I'm screamin', "Free my brother Blood, free my cousin Manu"
I keep the Glizzy in the club, and I ain't ever shot though
I let it off in H-Town, sprayin' fully auto
I swear that I ain't ever tell, but I prolly lie, though
They gon' send me right to jail if they knew what I knew
God'll send me right to Hell if he knew what I know
These candles on me, they burnin'
Cameras on me keep turnin'
Been through the worst, ain't gon' lie, this shit be hurtin'
I'm tryna turn my life right 'round
This fame be gettin' to my brain, I'm puttin' this mic right down
This shit flaw, this shit creep
In these city streets, ten toes deep, they try to sneak me
I'm just tryna eat, and keep it G, they don't wanna see me
I grind 'til I'm gone, yeah
Hood I put on, yeah
This weed is so strong, yeah
I grind 'til I'm gone, yeah
Grind 'til I'm gone, yeah
My hood I put on, yeah
This weed is so strong, yeah
I grind 'til I'm gone, yeahEmbed
