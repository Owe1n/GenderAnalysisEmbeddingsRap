Left Foot, Right Foot (#HandsUpAnthem) Lyrics
Yeah
2-17 on the track, man
Turn up right now

Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot
Go, hit it on 'em
Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot
Put yo hands up
Hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em
Go, hit it on 'em
Hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em
Put yo hands up
Okay, people, let's get started (Ayy)
I'm the turn up king
So I'm pipin' up, regardless (Ayy, ayy, ayy), like, ayy
If you can't dance, baby, that is okay
Left foot, right foot, come and swing my way
M-M-Memphis where I stay, but I'm always in the A
And when I do my dance, everybody like ayy
Swag surfin', caught a wave and I ain't coming back down
Left foot, right foot, turn up right now

Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot
Go, hit it on 'em
Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot
Put your hands up
Hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em
Go, hit it on 'em
Hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em

Put your hands up, then swing
I done walked in with 217 (217 on da track, man)
Left foot, right foot, then I JuJu on the beat
Stop, reverse, okay, that's a major key
Turn up right now
I-I-I just bought a whip
She wanna skedaddle, so I took her on a trip
And dabbin' is a habit, I hit the Quan and dip
Every time I come around (Yeah), left foot, right foot
Turn up right now

Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot
Go, hit it on 'em
L-L-L-Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot
Put your hands up
Hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em
Go, hit it on 'em
Hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em
Put your hands up

Row, row, row your boat, then I hit the lean
Reverse drop, don't stop vibin' to the beat
Swinging left to right (Hey), left to right (Hey)
Swinging left to right (Hey), left to right (Hey)
Screaming do 'thing he like, do 'thing he like
Do 'thing he like, do 'thing he like
Swinging left to right (Hey), left to right (Hey)
Swinging left to right (Yeah, hey), left
Turn up right now

Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot
Go, hit it on 'em
Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot
Put your hands up
Hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em
Go, hit it on 'em
Hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em
Put your hands up
When I'm in the north, they turnin' up of course
So if you from the north you better put your hands up
And when I'm in the east, they turn up in the streets
So if you from the east you better put your hands up
And when I'm in the west, all they do is flex
So if you in the west you need to put your hands up
And shoutout to the south 'cause I come from the south
Memphis 1020 Atlanta
Turn up right now

Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot
Go, hit it on 'em
Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot
Put your hands up
Hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em
Go, hit it on 'em
Hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em, hit it on 'em
Put your hands upEmbed
