Hello Lyrics
Dem Boyz!
We The Best, you the worse
You got heel with the nigga when we talkin' loud
Been a minute, gettin' money, still winnin', now I'm to it

I'm like that right, she must be from the street
She got a story for every man she meet
And man I swear I fuck her and I fell in love, for real
Fell in love, for real
I think she leavin' with me and she know the deal
Fell in love, for real
Oh-oh, I think I met her in the club
Oh-oh, I know she never get enough
Oh-oh, she got a bigger at too much
Oh, where I get her touch, that's a touch

I already know what's going on in your head
Better pop my mind, get in my bed
She crazy not to make me run away
But the pussy makin' a mil on a stay

I'm like that right, she must be from the street
She got a story for every man she meet
I'm like that right, I know she from the street
I see you lookin' through your lights up in your seat
And man I swear I fuck her and I fell in love, for real
Fell in love, for real
I think she leavin' with me and she know the deal
Fell in love, for real (Dolla $ign)

Said damn right, damn right
Damn, hand me my mirror
Damn right, damn right
Damn, I'm that nigga
Damn right, damn, damn
Damn, Dolla done laid the pipe
Damn right, damn, damn
We be fuckin' all night
I'ma pull up with mink coat
I'ma let her light my pre-roll
I'ma let her taste my ego
I'ma let her taste my ego
I'ma go cop some Saint Laurent
I'ma cop us some Saint Laurent
I'ma go cop some Gucci
I'ma cop her some Gucci
You might also like
I'm like that right, she must be from the street
She got a story for every man she meet
I'm like that right, I know she from the street
I see you lookin' through your lights up in your seat
And man I swear I fuck her and I fell in love, for real
Fell in love, for real
I think she leavin' with me and she know the deal
Fell in love, for real

Oh-oh, I think I met her in the club
Oh-oh, I know she never get enough
Oh-oh, she got a bigger at too much
Oh where I get her touch, that's a touch

I can see it in your eyes you went through shit (yea-yea)
I'm just tryna put you on some new shit (yea-yea)
We can talk about your problems then your future
I'm tryna tour a Porsche  (skurr-skurr)
Shoes on point, she's exclusive (yea-yea)
Ye gettin' money in  (yea-yea)
I'm lookin' in her eyes, she 
If you get P-Game, you're close (nigga)
Got a peep game, got a sea ship, shawty game tights, only screen shit
We ain't get her , speakin' body language
From the same world, we gon' 
Froze low about three levels, in a OG it's all tryna tell us
Hit the band, bitch gotta stay solid
And a real nigga is gotta do double
I'm like that right, she must be from the street
She got a story for every man she meet
I'm like that right, I know she from the street
I see you lookin' through your lights up in your seat

Shawty's too much, shawty's too much
Shawty's too much for a nigga like me
Might lay she down, burn bad Louis V
Can I blow a check then fuck you on the beach?
Don't do too much (don't do too much)
You wanna fuck for a nigga like me
I turn the pussy, gettin' head in the G (skurr)
Nigga what you say? I'm gettin' bread  in my sleep
Want it from me, spend love in three levels
OG is always tryna tell us
And the bad bitches gotta stay solid
And the real nigga is gotta do better
I'mma buy you everything for real
Just promise you always keep it real

I'm like that right, she must be from the street
She got a story for every man she meet
I'm like that right, I know she from the street
I see you lookin' through your lights up in your seat
And man I swear I fuck her and I fell in love, for real
Fell in love, for real
I think she leavin' with me and she know the deal
Fell in love, for real

Want it from me, spend love in three levels
OG is always tryna tell us
And the bad bitches gotta stay solid
And the real nigga is gotta do better
I'mma buy you everything for real
Just promise you always keep it real
Fuck that nigga, Henn' the shit he feel
Legs up in the foreign then let's spillEmbed
