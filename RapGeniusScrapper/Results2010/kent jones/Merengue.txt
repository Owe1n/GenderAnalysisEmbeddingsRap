Merengue Lyrics
Oh yeah
Dance
Dance merengue
Baby

Dance merengue with you, mama
Dance merengue, know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back to me
Dance merengue with you, mama
Dance merengue, know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back
Hey
Goddamn, how you did it like that?
Low skirt with a booty underneath it like that
Hot like a summer, girl, you so fine
And you know I'm trying to give it to you on top
Don't wanna let you go
But you put a wall up like Mexico
I ain't trying to gas you up like Texaco
I just really wanna, really wanna let you know

'Cause I know what you need
To make it through the night
I can get you right
And I know what you need
To make it through the night
I could ease your mind, baby
Boricua, morena
Boricua, morena
Dominicana, Columbiana
Americana, Italiana

Dance merengue with you, mama
Dance merengue, know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back to me
Dance merengue with you, mama
Dance merengue, know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back (To me)
You might also like
I just wanna let you know
I'mma take this dance never let you go
I know how you really feel if the rest don't know
She said, "I ain't really trying to profess, you know"
Fuck it, let's be professional
I know to get, never get to know
I ain't trying to save nothing
But on my insurance, I need to find me a girl on her Progressive flow

'Cause I know what you need
To make it through the night
I can get you right
And I know what you need
To make it through the night
I could ease your mind, baby
Boricua, morena
Boricua, morena
Dominicana, Columbiana
Americana, Italiana

Dance merengue with you, mama
Dance merengue, know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back to me
Dance merengue with you, mama
Dance merengue, know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back
Dance merengue with you, mama
Dance merengue, know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back to me
Dance merengue with you, mama
Dance merengue, know you wanna
A little Marc Anthony
It'll bring you right back (To me)
Dance merengue
Dance merengue with you, mama
Dance merengue
Dance merengue with you, mama
