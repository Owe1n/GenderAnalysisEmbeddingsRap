Bossanova Lyrics
God, oh my, oh my God (Bop, bop, bop, bop)
Oh my, oh my God, oh my (Bop, bop, bop, bop)
Oh my (Brrt), oh my God, oh my (Brrt)
Oh my (Uh)
(Hahaha, Nick, you're stupid)
(Uh-uh, uh-uh)

My baby, she flexin' all up on my blessings
I get a flash, nigga, with baguettes (Yeah)
We just seen a opp and we sent 'em to heaven (Yeah)
And it been so long, so the vibe so different
She say I'm Lil Tecca, so she let me hit it (Uh, uh)
Ain't respond to the text, nigga, but I read it
She told me she love me, nigga, had to dead it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, run to the pack, lil' nigga gotta get it
I don't know, are you gang, slime?
I don't know your gang sign
I don't know your intentions with my energy, see you later
She said, "Oh my God," like Lil Keed (Oh my)
And you givin' me stress, baby, I don't need (Oh my)
She said that she love me, she fuck on my team (Oh my, oh my)
How you say that you love me and fuck on my team? (Oh my)
I'm countin' the cash, yeah, I count the green (Green, cash)
I'm countin' the cash, yeah, I count the blue (Count the blue)
I got no pressure, nigga, game two (Pressure)
You know that you poppin' if they hate you (Yes)
I use it as motivation (Motivation)
'Cause I know that I'm going to be greatness (Gon' be great)
Spin the block like tornado
You a last nigga, you a outdated
Put me in Olympics, I run to that sack (Sack)
I feel like a doctor, she give me that back
I said, "Yo, WAV, pass the MAC" (MAC)
Finnessin' that pack and I might get it back (Finesse)
Always grindin', nigga I cannot slack (Slack)
I fucked your bitch, ha, that's a fact (Thotty)
I fucked yo' ho, nigga that's a fendi (Schemin')
I mixed the Prada, nigga, with the Fendi
I fuck on yo' bitch, her name Betty (Betty)
You fall in love, then it's deady (Deady)
'Cause I don't need no one, I don't know if I'm ready
I ain't goin' to the party, baby, we goin' to the Getty
I ain't tryna' touch you, baby, shawty you just met me

My baby, she flexin' all up on my blessings
I get a flash, nigga, with baguettes (Yeah)
We just seen a opp and we sent 'em to heaven (Yeah)
And it been so long, so the vibe so different
She say I'm Lil Tecca, so she let me hit it (Oh my)
Ain't respond to the text, nigga, but I read it
She told me she love me, nigga, had to dead it (Yeah)
Yeah, run to the pack, lil' nigga gotta get it (Bop, bop, bop, bop)
I don't know, are you gang, slime?
I don't know your gang sign
I don't know your intentions with my energy, see you later
She said, "Oh my God," like Lil Keed (Oh my)
And you givin' me stress, baby, I don't need (Oh my)
She said that she love me, she fuck on my team (Oh my, oh my)
How you say that you love me and fuck on my team? (Oh my)
