TranslationsLil Tecca - NEVER LEFT (Traducción al Español)ItalianoNEVER LEFT Lyrics
(Perfect!)
Hope for the whole gang
I got hope for the whole gang
Hope for the—
Oh, no
Oh, wow
Oh, yeah
Nah (Yeah)
Smoke for the pain
Got some hopes for the gang
Hopes for the gang
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (On my shit)
(We love you, Tecca)
Know it's gon' be easy to me (To me), I got a bankroll (Bankroll)
Shooters doing what I say so (Say so), 'cause they on payroll (Payroll)
I got all purple on my shoes, I look like Saints Row (Yeah, yeah)
If I let you take my flick, you better catch my angles
Yeah, Vercetti, want old vibes, came back like I never left
Said that she gon' let me hit, came back, now she undressed
Thought you got my real love, girl, that was another test (Yeah, yeah)
Vercetti, want old vibes, came back like I never left

Only do it if it feel natural, I can't force this shit
They say, "Where you get that swag from?" Bitch, I bought this shit
If you ask me, then I'm number one, but that's my opinion
You could go and check the stats yourself, just start soundin' in it
Niggas tryna compete with me, in the same lane (Skrrt, skrrt)
Fuck around, I make my own wave, see if they maintain (In my wave)
I'm feelin' like I'm Almighty So, nigga, bang-bang (Grrah, grrah, grrah)
Got some hopes for the gang-gang, smoke for the pain-pain (Yeah)

Fashion, fashion, yeah, fashion fanatic, yeah, yeah
To money, a addict, yeah, yeah, the money and baddies, yeah, yeah
Got so much packs on me, you would think I be trappin', yeah, yeah
I guess that's what happens, yeah, yeah, when you really got it, yeah, yeah

Know it's gon' be easy to me, I got a bankroll (Bankroll)
Shooters doing what I say so (Say so), 'cause they on payroll (Payroll)

If I let you take my flick, you better catch my angles
Yeah, Vercetti, want old vibes, came back like I never left
Said that she gon' let me hit, came back, now she undressed (Yeah, yeah)
Thought you got my real love, girl, that was another test (Oh, woah)
Vercetti, want old vibes, came back like I never left

What you tryna talk about? ('Bout), it ain't none 'bout money (Yeah)
I don't hear no notification, not the bank callin' (Callin')
Got the keys, I could pick a door like the warden (Like the—)
You can't even roll up my gas, blunts floatin' (Like a—, like a—)
What even? What happened? Yeah (Like a—)
I'm rockin' Virgil in Paris, yeah (What?)
Oh, that's your bitch? I'm embarrassed, yeah (What?)
Boy, you're my son, carriage, yeah (Carriage)
We havin' fun with this shit still, I can tell that you're overthinkin'
I could do it with my eyes closed, you can see that I'm barely blinkin' (Blink)

Fashion, fashion, yeah, fashion fanatic, yeah, yeah
To money, a addict, yeah, yeah, the money and baddies, yeah, yeah

I got all purple on my shoes, I look like Saints Row (Saints Row)
If I let you take my flick, you better catch my angle (Angle)
Yeah, Vercetti, want old vibes, came back like I never left (Brr)
Said that she gon' let me hit, came back, now she undressed (Yeah, yeah)
Thought you got my real love, girl, that was another test (Oh, woah)
Vercetti, want old vibes, came back like I never left (Left)30Embed
