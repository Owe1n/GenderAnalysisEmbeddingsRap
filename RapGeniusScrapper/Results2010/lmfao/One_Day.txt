One Day Lyrics
Sipping on this drink, had some time to think
About where I was, and where am I'm at today
I'm getting everything I ask for
Flyin' the world, filling up my passport
I'm in the zone, my team is strong
My time is short, but my money long
I'm getting everything I ask for
In the club, always keep my glass full

Money in the bank, my car brand new (Yeah)
I got everything I want but you (Ay-Oh)
I might get you one day (Ay-Oh)
I might get you one day
House on the hill, Hollywood view
I got everything I want but you (Ay-Oh)
I might get you one day (Ay-Oh)
I might get you one day
Hey, everybody came to play
I love it when you DJ
Plays all my favorite songs
And e'erybody sings along
I see the pretty babies at the pool
But all I can think about is you

Money in the bank, my car brand new (Yeah)
I got everything I want but you (Ay-Oh)
I might get you one day (Ay-Oh)
I might get you one day
House on the hill, Hollywood view
I got everything I want but you (Ay-Oh)
I might get you one day (Ay-Oh)
I might get you one day

When I get you girl, you gonna be so in love with me
Every day, we're gonna play, what's your fantasy?
Every night I think of you in every way
And when I get you, I'mma celebrate

Hey, I'mma celebrate
Whoo, I'mma celebrate
I'm gonna celebrate
'Cause I'm gonna get you one dayYou might also like2Embed
