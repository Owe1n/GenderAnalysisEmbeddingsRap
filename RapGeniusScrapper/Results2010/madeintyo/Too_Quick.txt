Too Quick Lyrics
I love The Private Club
Nard & B

Had to get a brand new bih (Ooh)
Cause I get bored too quick (Sauce)
Had to get a brand new ice (Skrrt-skrrt)
'Cause I get bored too quick (Wham)
Cut her off, upgrade (Wham), got bored too quick
Lifeguard lemonade (Wham), just flood my wrist
I get bored too quick (Ooh), I get bored too quick (Ooh)
I get bored too quick (Sauce), I get bored too quick
Cut her off, upgrade (Yeah), got bored too quick
Lifeguard lemonade (Ooh), just flood my wrist
Ooh, chop the top, never stop, I get bored too quick
Silly thot, want my spot, I get bored too quick
Louis V, watch 'em hang, I could see your bitch
She be choosing on the low, I can't save that bitch
Yeezy hanging out the window, I've got lots of handles
Shout out to Gwen and Wesley Foo, that my kinfolk
Been tweaking lately, all my shit gotta be exotic
Baby blue Porsche that shit look like Hpnotiq

Had to get a brand new bih (Ooh)
Cause I get bored too quick (Sauce)
Had to get a brand new ice (Skrrt-skrrt)
'Cause I get bored too quick (Wham)
Cut her off, upgrade (Wham), got bored too quick
Lifeguard lemonade (Wham), just flood my wrist
I get bored too quick (Ooh), I get bored too quick (Ooh)
I get bored too quick (Sauce), I get bored too quick
Cut her off, upgrade (Yeah), got bored too quick
Lifeguard lemonade (Ooh), just flood my wrist

Gucci duffel, bust yo bubble, ugh, you ain't hot
Saint Laurent winter jacket, had it 'fore it drop
Told Distorted if she want it, cop that BM drop
Kinjin ice me up, Meechie pipe me up
Mr. Ice cream truck, can you ice me up?
Shawty just show love, Tokyo give no fuck
She let the YSL hang, I told her tootle that thang
TPC, that my gang, she wanna kiss the chain

Had to get a brand new bih (Ooh)
Cause I get bored too quick (Sauce)
Had to get a brand new ice (Skrrt-skrrt)
'Cause I get bored too quick (Wham)
Cut her off, upgrade (Wham), got bored too quick
Lifeguard lemonade (Wham), just flood my wrist
I get bored too quick (Ooh), I get bored too quick (Ooh)
I get bored too quick (Sauce), I get bored too quick
Cut her off, upgrade (Yeah), got bored too quick
Lifeguard lemonade (Ooh), just flood my wrist9Embed
