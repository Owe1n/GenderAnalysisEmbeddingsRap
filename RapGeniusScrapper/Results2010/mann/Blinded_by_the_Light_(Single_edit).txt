Blinded by the Light (Single edit) LyricsBlinded by the light
Wrapped up like a deuce
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Wrapped up like a deuce
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Wrapped up like a deuce...
Madman drummers bummers
Indians in the summer
With a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps
As the adolescent pumps
His way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder
Feeling kinda older
I tripped a merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing
Sneezing and wheezing
The calliope crashed to the ground
The calliope crashed to the ground
Oh, she was blinded by the light
Wrapped up like a deuce
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Wrapped up like a deuce
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Wrapped up like a deuce
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Wrapped up like a deuce
Another runner in the night
Some silicone sister
With her manager mister
Told me I've got what it takes
She said
"I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong
Play the song with the funky break"
And go-kart Mozart
Was checking out the weather chart
To see if it was safe outside
And little Early Pearly
Came by in his curly wurly
And asked me if I needed a ride

'Cause she was blinded by the light
Wrapped up like a deuce
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Wrapped up like a deuce
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light (Madman drummers bummers
Indians in the summer)
Wrapped up like a deuce (With a teenage diplomat)
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light (In the dumps with the mumps
As the adolescent pumps)
Wrapped up like a deuce (His way into his hat)
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light (With a boulder on my shoulder
Feeling kinda older)
Wrapped up like a deuce (I tripped a merry-go-round)
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light (With this very unpleasing
Sneezing and wheezing)
Wrapped up like a deuce (The calliope crashed to the ground)
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light (Now Scott with a slingshot
Finally found a tender spot)
Wrapped up like a deuce (And throws his lover in the sand)
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light (And some bloodshot forget-me-not
Said, "Daddy's within earshot'')
Wrapped up like a deuce ("Save the buckshot and turn up the band")
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light (Some silicone sister
With her manager mister)
Wrapped up like a deuce (Told me I've got what it takes)
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light (She said
"I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong")
She got down but she never got tight
She's gonna make it through the nightEmbed
