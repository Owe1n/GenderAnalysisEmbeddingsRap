Davyâ€™s on the Road Again Lyrics
Davy's on the road again
Wearin' different clothes again
Davy's turning handouts down
To keep his pockets clean
All his goods are sold again
His word's as good as gold again
Says, "If you see Jean, now
Ask her, please, to pity me"

"Jean and I, we moved along
Since the day down in the hollow
When the mind went driftin' on
And the feet were soon to follow"
Davy's on the road again
Wearin' different clothes again
Davy's turning handouts down
To keep his pockets clean
Sayin' his goodbyes again
Wheels are in his eyes again
Says, "If you see Jean, now
Ask her, please, to pity me"

Downtown in the big town
Gonna set you back on your heels
With a mouth full of memories
And a lot of stickers for my windshield

Shut the door, cut the light
Davy won't be home tonight
You can wait 'til the dawn rolls in
You won't see our Davy again

(Davy's on the road again)
(Again, again, again, again)
(Davy's on the road again)
(Again, again, again, again)
You might also like
Davy's on the road again
Wearin' different clothes again
Davy's turning handouts down
To keep his pockets clean
All his goods are sold again
His word's as good as gold again
Says, "If you see Jean, now
Ask her, please, to pity me"

"Jean and I, we moved along
Since the day down in the hollow
When the mind went driftin' on
And the feet were soon to follow"

Davy's on the road again
Wearin' different clothes again
Davy's turning handouts down
To keep his pockets clean
Sayin' his goodbyes again
Wheels are in his eyes again...Embed
