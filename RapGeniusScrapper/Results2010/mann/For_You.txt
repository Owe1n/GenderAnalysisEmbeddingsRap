For You Lyrics
Princess cards she sends me
With her regards
Oh, barroom eyes shine vacancy
To see her you gotta look hard
Wounded deep in battle
I stand stuffed like some soldier undaunted
To her cheshire smile, I'll stand on file
She's all I ever wanted

You let your blue walls get in the way of these facts, honey
Get your carpetbaggers off my back
Girl, give me time to cover my tracks
She said, "Here's your mirror and your ball and jacks"
But they're not what I came for
Oh, I came for so much more
And I know you know that, too (I came for you)
And I know you know that's true (I came for you)
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you, for you, I came for you

Crawl into my ambulance
Your pulse is getting weak
Reveal yourself all to me now
While you got the strength to speak
'Cause they're waiting for you at Bellevue
With their oxygen masks
But I could give it all to you now
If only you could ask

Don't call for your surgeon, even he says it's late
It's not your lungs this time but your heart holds your fate
Don't give me my money back, don't want it anymore
It's not that nursery mouth I came back for
It's not the way you stretched out on the floor
I've broken all your windows and I rammed through all your doors
And who am I to ask you to fight my wars
And you should know that's true (I came for you)
You should know that, too (I came for you)
You might also like
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you, for you, I came for you


Don't call for your surgeon, even he says it's late
It's not your lungs this time but your heart holds your fate
Don't give me my money back, don't want it anymore
It's not that nursery mouth I came back for
It's not the way you stretched out on the floor
I've broken all your windows and I rammed through all your doors
Who am I to ask you to fight my wars
And you should know that's true (I came for you)
You should know that, too (I came for you)

I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you
I came for you, for you, I came for you

I came for you
I came for you1Embed
