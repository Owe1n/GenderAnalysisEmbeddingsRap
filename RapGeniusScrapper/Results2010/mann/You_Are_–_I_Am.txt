You Are â€“ I Am Lyrics
You are, you are, you are
You are, you are, you are
You are the moment Martha's mad man came out of the darkness
You are, you are, you are
The eye glass of the nearly, nearly blind
You are the foot print in the sand of Easter Island
You are, you are, you are
The fusion in the furnace of the sun

I am the captain cried across the lonely sea
I am undoubtly what I'll be
I am the soldier sang across the lonely field
I am and I'll do whatever I feel

You are the time between solar fire and the silence
You are, you are, you are
You are the last chord in the symphony of the lost
You are the sign between the high road and the low road
You are, you are, you are
You are the pen in the moving hand of time


You are the last post played by the Alamo soldier
You are, you are, you are
You are a spaceman at the very edge of time
You are the single shaft of sunlight in the night time
You are, you are, you are
You are the coolness in the very heat of the fire
You are the moment Martha's madman came out of darkness
You are, you are, you are
You are the eyeglass of the nearly, nearly blind
You are, you are, you areYou might also likeEmbed
