Beat Box First Day Out Lyrics
Brrt (Come here)

Ayy, walk him down straight to the ground, we make sure that he don't get up (Damn E, this shit exclusive, don't get up)
Call the reverend and his mama (Yeah, gone), tell 'em, "Come and pick him up" (Come and pick him up)
I'ma smack you with this forty, askin', "Is my Glizzy tucked?" (Is my Glizzy tucked?)

Only like it sloppy, she gon' beatbox when she suckin' me (Come here, come here)
Told her, "Bring a friend", if she ever think about fuckin' me
Touchin' who? Touchin' mе, to God where your ass gon' be (Brrt)
Lеave him stuck and send him up, like he fuckin' with Cardi B (Brrt, brrt, brrt)
Park the car before we hit the street, I'm hoppin' out on feet (Better on feet)
Get up close so I can see his teeth but I'ma keep it brief
Asked if he remember me, then introduced him to my heat (Remember me?)
Skrrt off the block, you followin' this car, your whip be cream cheese (Come here, brrt)
Ain't no bush to beat around (Ayy), you not duckin' a hundred rounds (Not duckin')
Whole hood been down, fuck the count 'cause we just beat it down ('Cause we just beat it down)
Ain't gotta spin back around because my target hit the ground (My target hit the ground)
Crossed that line, you out of bounds, they gon' find you up in the crowd (No, no)
Nappy-ass dreadlocks, black Forces, black socks (Ayy, ayy, brrt)
Make the Draco pop, it's louder than a boombox (Brrt, brrt, brrt)
Shoutout to OVO, this Drac' can make your bed rock (Make your bed rock)
We beat them four and oh, just check the score, it say a lot (Ayy, check the score, bitch)
Ayy, I'm in Miami, she givin' me head on Ocean Drive while her nigga outside
Sucked me so good, I thought that I died
But when I nutted, I had came back alive
Skeet on her face, it got in her eyes
Now she tellin' me she legally blind
Gave her a towel and told her she fine
She kept suckin' 'til she started cryin' (Come here, come here)
Point 'em out, shoot 'em out, I spot him, I got him (Come here)
He started runnin', so I caught him (Ayy, ayy)
Bag on his head, I bought him (Ayy)
Told my shooter do everything that I taught him (Ayy)
Let me know if it's a problem
Like a schoolboy, I be super quick to solve it
Thinkin' my shooter retarded
He take a pill and then snort it right off of his forty
Snort it right off of his gun
Shot a hundred (Yeah), then paid a hundred for his bond (No, no)
Send a diss, I won't respond (No)
Slam dunk a nigga like a nigga was LeBron (Come here)
Leave a nigga where he stay
Same place that I met him, I made him lay (Come here, come here)
Let a nigga come and play
He gon' tell his momma, "Plan the funeral date" (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
I got the power like Nelson Mandela
You need an umbrella whenever I spray (Whenever I spray)
Leave him shitty like Nutella
He gon' need a Pamper if he survive this K ('Vive this, ayy)
Me and my niggas, we down for whatever
We step on whoever in retro J's (Retro J's)
Bullet, stick like a thorn, call it Bella
Make him Cinderella if he betray, bitch
Ayy, walk him down straight to the ground, we make sure that he don't get up (Damn E, this shit exclusive)
Call the reverend and his mama, tell 'em, "Come and pick him up"
I'ma smack you with this forty, askin', "Is my Glizzy tucked?" (Glizzy tucked)You might also like23Embed
