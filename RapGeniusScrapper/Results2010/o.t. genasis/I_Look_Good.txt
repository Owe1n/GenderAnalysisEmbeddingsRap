I Look Good Lyrics
B-B-Bankroll Got It

I look real good today
I look real good today
I look real good today
I look real good today

Jumpin' out the motherfuckin' Bentley (Yeah)
Rolley in the casa, new Balencis (Yah)
Walkin' with a pocket full of Benjis (Cash)
And my ten piece
I look real good today
I look real good today
I look real good today
I look real good today

Dive in the pussy like scuba (Ooh)
Mami look good, she from Cuba
All white like cocaine (Gang)
I spend a lotta money on my chain
Keep me a strap like Rambo (Bah)
Plug hit my phone that Fernando (Brrr)
Always trappin', cookin' in a bando (Yah)
Look at my face (Face), classy man go

I look real good today
I look real good today
I look real good today
I look real good today

Jumpin' out the motherfuckin' Bentley (Yeah)
Rolley in the casa, new Balencis (Yah)
Walkin' with a pocket full of Benjis (Cash)
And my ten piece

I look real good today
I look real good today
I look real good today
I look real good todayEmbed
