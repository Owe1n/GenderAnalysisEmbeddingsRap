Selfish Lyrics
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh yeah
I want you all to myself
You don't need nobody else
I want you all to myself, I swear, yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm selfish
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear
I want you all to myself because I'm selfish, yeah
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear
I want you all to myself, I swear, I'm selfish
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear
I want you all to myself because I'm selfish, yeah
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else
I want you all to myself
Now, that I got you here, girl, I ain't gon' play with you
Because it's a lot of things that I wanna say to you
Girl, you know you the shit, Balenciagas on your kicks
Niggas all on your dick, but we ain't gon' trip
'Cause I'm not ready for no commitments (Nah, nah)
But I swear I hate seeing you with them (Yeah, yeah)
And I know you ain't tryna control me
And I know you tired of being lonely
I can't help how I feel, I'm just keeping it real
They can't have you, girl, becauseâ€”

I'm selfish
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear
I want you all to myself because I'm selfish, yeah
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear
I want you all to myself, I swear, I'm selfish
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear
I want you all to myself because I'm selfish, yeah
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else
I want you all to myself

Shawty, I'm selfish, can't help it
You know I get stuck when you come around
And them niggas be sick 'cause we be on some shit
Yeah, they know I'm gon' hold it down
Pull up in the whip
Tell you hop in with your friends, we gon' go to my crib
Have my chef cook us up a dinner
Girl, you know you fuckin' with a winner
I ain't nothin' like these lames, I swear
Name a place, I could take you there
I'd do anything to make you laugh
And you can have anything, just ask
But just know that I'm selfish
And I swear I can't help it
But it's all for you
Yeah, it's all for you

I'm selfish
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear
I want you all to myself because I'm selfish, yeah
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear
I want you all to myself, I swear, I'm selfish
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else, I swear
I want you all to myself because I'm selfish, yeah
I want you all to myself, I swear
You don't need nobody else
I want you all to myself68Embed
