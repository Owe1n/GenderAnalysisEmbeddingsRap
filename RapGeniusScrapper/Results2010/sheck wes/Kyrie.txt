Kyrie Lyrics
Kyrie, where's LeBron?
Suck my dick!
Caution, danger
Caution, caution
Kyrie, K-K-Kyrie
Might break your ankle
Saucin’
Bitch!

Kyrie, K-K-K-Kyrie
Ballin' like I'm Kyrie, K-K-K-Kyrie
I mix it, like Byrie, B-B-B-Byrie
Sauce ’em up, Kyrie, K-K-K-Kyrie
Bitch! (Mudboy)
You know I'm on the green team (Bitch!)
Uh, boogers in my ear, make them say "Bling-bling" (Ching)
You know I'm the bomb, ball like I'm on TNT
Huh, Jayson Tatum, rookie, how I'm ballin' in the sleeve (Sleeve)
Racks in my jeans (Jeans)
No ash on my fleece (Nah)
First round draft picks, throw 'em in the V (Car)
Two plus two, that's fo’
I give ’em to the Cleve
Go divide two 11, sauce 'em up, that’s me ballin'
Like I'm at the JBC, huh
Ballin' on the floor, you watch me from the nosebleeds
Talkin’ shit, I lay him down like Kyrie

K-K-Kyrie, K-K-K-Kyrie (I sauce 'em)
I sauce 'em up like Kyrie, K-K-K-Kyrie (I sauce 'em)
I mix it, like Byrie, B-B-B-Byrie (Bitch! Yeah)
Sauce it up like Kyrie, K-K-K-Kyrie (Bitch! Yeah)
I mix it, like Byrie, B-B-B-Byrie (I sauce 'em)

I said, uh
Young nigga, 19 (Teen)
Jayson Tatum, rookie, how I'm ballin' in this league (Zero)
I said, "Ooh shit"
Rookie in this league, huh
Jayson Tatum, how I'm ballin' on this team
I said, "Ooh shit"
Caution, danger (Oh shit)
Don't try to guard me (Don't guard me)
Might break your ankle
I said, "Ooh shit" (Bitch!)
Crossing danger (Caution)
I cross you over, and break your ankles
I said, "Ooh bitch" (Bitch!)
You know I'll tame you (Tame you)
You say you taken (Taken)
I shake your ankles (Shake it)
I said, "Ooh bitch"
I be dunkin' (Dunkin')
And a layup (Huh-huh)
Have to 2K it

I said K-K-Kyrie, K-K-K-Kyrie
I sauce 'em up like Kyrie, B-B-B-Byrie
Mix it, like Byrie, B-B-B-Byrie
Sauce 'em up like Kyrie, K-K-K-Kyrie

K-K-Kyrie, K-K-K-Kyrie
(Ooh shit, crossing danger)
Balling on these niggas like I'm at the, at the
At the JBC (Ooh shit)
At the, at the JBC (Crossing danger, cross you over)
Might break your ankles
Mudboy!
