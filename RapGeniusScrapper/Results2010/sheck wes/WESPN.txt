WESPN Lyrics
Mudboy
(Fah fah, fah fah fah fah fah fah)
Bitch
E-S, E-S, ESPN

They don't like my rap style (Nah)
Now they want features (Nah)
I turned all my doubters, into my believers (Sheck Wes)
Arguin' my damn ma (Fuck)
Fightin' with my teachers (Bitch)
Skip my game for the fashion show (For the show)
One of my best decisions (Facts)
Backwood addiction (I got it)
I got a Backwood addiction
Ain't the THC, that's facts, non-fiction
Or is this shit fiction?
But remember in school, I ain't pay attention
In school, I ain't pay attention
I watched E-S, E-S, ESPN
W-E-S, E-S, we fuck with him (Yeah)
W-E-S, E-S, we don't need top ten (Yeah, bitch)
W-E-S, E-S, we fuck with him
W-E-S, E-S, ESPN
W-E-S, E-S

Goin' through a damn phase (Through a phase)
Goin' through my damn change (Cosmos)
Goin' through my damn passport (Passport)
I been goin' through these damn pages
Smokin 'on maoda (maoda)
Hoes sniffing on powder (Sniff, sniff)
The money bring the power
But the money bring you problems, so when..
You niggas get stuck, don't call
Please don't call, don't call Sheck, Wes no more
Cause I ain't pickin' up my mothafuckin' phone (Bitch)

Do not disturb, put it on the phone
I ain't pickin' up your calls no more
Please do not call my phone
If you ain't talkin' 'bout the motherfuckin' dough
Do not disturb, put it on my phone
I ain't pickin' up your calls no more
Please do not call my phone
If you ain't talkin' 'bout the motherfuckin', dough

They just want the turnt shit (Turn up, bitch)
They don't like the sad music (Nigga, burn up)
Sheck Wes been in a sad state (A sad state)
You ain't never had to do shit, huh? (Never)
You ain't never had to (Fuck) go through shit (Bitch)
You ain't ever have to (Fuck) go and shoot shit (Never)
You ain't never had to (What?) go and choose shit
