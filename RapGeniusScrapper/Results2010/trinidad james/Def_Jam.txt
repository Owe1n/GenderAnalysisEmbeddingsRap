Def Jam Lyrics
Yo, comin’ to you live from the A
This your South Side boy
You know, Atlanta boy
Trinidad James, and I’m checkin’ it with my niggas
The best clothes in the game
DJ Teflon
And this is the FYM
Exclusive, fuck you mean, nigga?

I be a nigga that always stay real
Being a real nigga got me a deal
They say he go crazy, they say he too real
But being a real nigga got me a deal
I'm the young nigga that always stay real
Being a real nigga got me a deal
They say he go crazy, they say he too real
But being a real nigga got me a deal
I want all these hoes to know
That a real nigga just hit the door
No more Versace get off of my clothes
I did not beg for this fame, I was chose
I can act different with all of my flows
Thugnificent in the flesh and in the soul
I was that nigga that folded the clothes
Now I’m that nigga that’s rockin’ the shows
You think you know me, but you do not know
I King Midas my Audi and turn it to gold
I tell all of my niggas I love them or so
I can’t focus on niggas to show me no love
Cause I came in the game and I showed niggas love
Cause I came in the game and I swiped niggas up
I fuck with security, don’t fuck with no chumps
I used to smile in their face but I give them no trust
Yo DJ a real nigga, tell ‘em
(Turn this bitch up!)

I be a nigga that always stay real
Being a real nigga got me a deal
They say he go crazy, they say he too real
But being a real nigga got me a deal
I'm the young nigga that always stay real
Being a real nigga got me a deal
They say he go crazy, they say he too real
But being a real nigga got me a deal
You might also like
Tell all these chill ass niggas
Don’t play with me, playa
Cause yo niggas owe me some favors
That mean that they play for me, playa
Might not believe me, but I have no reason
To talk or to hate on you, playa
I am too busy, smokin’ on gas
And makin’ a way for my niggas
My niggas got kids, they momma be trippin’
Momma be paid, give that bitch what she want
I don’t check my account and I know that I save enough
Knowledge, my nigga, my God is so serious
A pimp to the cane, are you hearin me niggas?
Just tryna make it, they playin’ you, nigga?
Child support late, they ain’t payin’ a nigga?
Shout on the radio, you stay with yo nigga
Owe me some money then pay up, pay up, pay up
Pay up lil' nigga

I be a nigga that always stay real
Being a real nigga got me a deal
They say he go crazy, they say he too real
But being a real nigga got me a deal
I'm the young nigga that always stay real
Being a real nigga got me a deal
They say he go crazy, they say he too real
But being a real nigga got me a deal8Embed
