Kick her out when we fucked, I'm a dog (Grr)
Fuck a cop, I don't fuck with the law
Her nigga, he workin' from nine to the five
I pull up and fuck her while he on the job
I get in it and hit it then I'm sleepy, I'm tired
Had to get her an Uber, bitch needed a ride (Mmm)
Wanna fuck me she always see me with the mob
She get paid when she there like a freak, it's a job
