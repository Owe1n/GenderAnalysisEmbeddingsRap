Leave Me On Read Lyrics
I hit you with that double text
Where you at? What you doin'? You ain’t seen it yet
I'm seein' blue, blue, blue, baby, that’s a bag, uh
Call you one time, 'cause I gotta check, ooh-ooh
How you not gon' answer? Postin' on your Insta
Baby, where your manners? Don't you know I hit ya? Ayy
Science ain't that good, talkin' more expensive
You act like I ain't worthy of no second chances

Oh, you mad-mad, huh?
That’s what’s you're best at, huh?
Girl it’s only midnight, oh-oh
So why you gotta go and—
Leave me on read
Flexin', actin' like you didn't get the message
Sayin’ that I'm talkin to my exes
You ain't gotta, leave me on read
I'm stressin', actin' like you didn't get the message
Sayin' that I'm talkin to my exes
You ain't gotta, leave me on read

I know you saw my text, it's been fifteen minutes (Woah)
You be 'round your girl, you just want attention (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Now you talkin' crazy, need an intervention (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I tried to tell you once but you ain't never listen

So, you mad-mad, huh?
That's what's you're best at, huh?
Girl it's only midnight, oh-oh
So why you gotta go and—

Leave me on read
Flexin' (Flexin'), actin' like you didn't get the message (Message)
Sayin' that I'm talkin to my exes (Exes)
You ain't gotta, leave me on read (Oh, oh)
I'm stressin' (Oh, oh), actin' like you didn't get the message (Oh, oh)
Sayin' that I'm talkin to my exes
You ain't gotta, leave me on read
You might also like
Hahahaha
Baby, you don't gotta leave a nigga on read
Know you see text message, text me back
Aight please, yeah, damn
You ain't gotta (You ain't gotta)

Leave me on read
Flexin', actin' like you didn't get the message (Get the message)
Sayin' that I'm talkin to my exes (To my exes)
You ain't gotta, leave me on read
I'm stressin' (I know you saw my text, please), actin' like you didn't get the message (I know you got the message)
Sayin' that I'm talkin to my exes
You ain't gotta, leave me on read
