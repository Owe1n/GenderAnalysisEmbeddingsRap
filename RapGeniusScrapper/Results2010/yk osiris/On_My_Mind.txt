On My Mind Lyrics
I know you love me like you feel me
You know what's the funny part about it?
I'm just freestylin'
I ain't, I ain't even, I'm pourin' my heart out
I'm just tryna tell you how I feel about you 'cause you're, listen

Baby girl I know it's hard to see
Other niggas steady lyin' so it's hard to be like
I know that you afraid that I'ma hurt you
But you steady on my mind so I can't curve you
I can give it what you need, what you really want
I can show what I know, what you wanna know?
I can take you overseas, where you wanna go?
I can let you slip away but I can't let you go
Love fades, baby girl what you wanna do?
Ask me who this steady callin', I don't have a clue
When them girls steady comin', I come straight to you
I know that you feel the pain but you gon' make it through
I know that you feel the pain girl, nah nah
Baby I ain't playin' games girl, nah nah
We in a whole 'nother lane girl, yeah yeah
And I know you feel the same girl

I can't waste no time baby, you been on my line baby
I been on your line baby, and you been on my mind
I can't waste no time baby, you been on my line baby
I been on your line baby, and you been on my mindYou might also likeEmbed
