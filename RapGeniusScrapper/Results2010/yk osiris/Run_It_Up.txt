Run It Up Lyrics
Hahaha
Babe you know
(Yo Kiwi, thank you, bro)
You know anything you want, you can have it babe
I ain't trippin'
It's only a matter of time

What you know about me, 'cause I know 'bout you
Bae do what we do, you could be my boo
Girl, we can run it up, we can go and stunt
I can be your thug, tell me what you want girl
Ride through the city like whoa
Baby, we can ride through the city like whoa
Tell me what you need bae, I won't say no
You know you can have it baby, anything you want
What you know about me, 'cause I know 'bout you
Bae do what we do, you could be my boo
Yeah we can run it up, we can go and stunt
Yeah I can be your thug, tell me what you want girl
You won't see you, well I see you
Us against the world, it's just me and you
I don't care about your man, fuck is he gon' do?
Hundred girls in my crib, I wanna leave with you
Spend a check with you and get it right back
Got me caught up in your loving, I can't fight back
I love you heavy fucked them girls and I came right back
My homie tell me that I'm trippin', might just right that, yeah
Got your neck wrist lit up, everything glitter
I might go take you to the mall, I'm a big spender
You want a real big bag, you know I go get 'em
I got fifty girls in the crib, I let my bros hit 'em
Might just be in love with you, I can't lie
You show me so much love, that shit you can't buy
I swear you got my heart, them girls they ain't mine
I might just kick her out my folks and let my main ride

What you know about me, 'cause I know 'bout you
Bae do what we do, you could be my boo
Girl, we can run it up, we can go and stunt
I can be your thug, tell me what you want girl
Ride through the city like whoa
Baby, we can ride through the city like whoa
Tell me what you need bae, I won't say no
You know you can have it baby, anything you want
What you know about me, 'cause I know 'bout you
Bae do what we do, you could be my boo
Yeah we can run it up, we can go and stunt
Yeah I can be your thug, tell me what you want girl
You might also like
Heard you want a thug in your life
Well come and let a thug do you right
I hope you don't believe all the hype
You should come and be with me for the night
Don't be runnin' back to your ex nigga, girl my check bigger
I'm gon' be your last, ain't no next nigga
Hit it from the left and right side, I'ma switch hitter
Crop him out the frame and get the big picture
I just got a check, help me run through it
Countin' up these hundreds, it ain't nothin' to it
Once I give you half my heart, you can't run through it, ayy

What you know about me, 'cause I know 'bout you
Bae do what we do, you could be my boo
Girl, we can run it up, we can go and stunt
I can be your thug, tell me what you want girl
Ride through the city like whoa
Baby, we can ride through the city like whoa
Tell me what you need bae, I won't say no
You know you can have it baby, anything you want
What you know about me, 'cause I know 'bout you
Bae do what we do, you could be my boo
Yeah we can run it up, we can go and stunt
Yeah I can be your thug, tell me what you want girl1Embed
