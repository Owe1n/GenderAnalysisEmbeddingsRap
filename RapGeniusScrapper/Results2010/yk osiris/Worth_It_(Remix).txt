Worth It (Remix) Lyrics
I would give you the world, nah, nah, nah
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I would give you the world, baby girl
You just gotta be worth it (Oh, oh, oh)
You don't gotta be perfect (Mm, mm, mm)
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I would give you the world, baby girl
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah
But you don't gotta be perfect (Oh, oh, oh)
You just gotta be worth it, (Lil' Tory) yeah, yeah (Ayy), yeah, nah, nah
I will give you the world, baby girl
Let me swerve, let me slide in it
I dive in it, if it's worth gettin' wet, I Poseidon it
I will give you the world, rocks and them pearls
All for my girl, offer the world
To you baby, time and time again
I've been puttin' all up on the line again
I done said that you fine a couple time
But ain't nothin' to say that you fine again
I'm just happy to say that you mine again
I'm not here to complain with your mind again
You done got on top it, and it's so deep
Had to bring the car to a slow creep
I'm just happy the Lord sent a sign again
And my nigga, oh, remind him why again

I would give you the world, baby girl
You just gotta be worth it (Oh, oh, oh)
You don't gotta be perfect (You don't gotta be perfect, mmh, mmh, mmh)
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I would give you the world, baby girl
You just gotta be worth it (You just gotta be worth), yeah, yeah
But you don't gotta be perfect (Oh, oh, oh)
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah, yeah, nah, nah (Dolla $ign)

You know that I'll give you the world, long as you my girl
Won't let these hoes in between
I keep you dripped in Céline
Tattoo my name on your body, I just might buy you a ring
Give you the keys to the V, you ride around on me, yeah, yeah
Uh, put it in drive for me, uh
Keepin' it tight for me, ayy
I love how you work it, ayy
Shawty you worth it

I would give you the world, baby girl
You just gotta be worth it (Oh, oh, oh)
You don't gotta be perfect (You don't gotta be perfect, mmh, mmh, mmh)
You just gotta be worth it, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I would give you the world, baby girl
You just gotta be worth it (You just gotta be worth), yeah, yeah
