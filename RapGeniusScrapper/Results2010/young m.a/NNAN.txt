NNAN Lyrics
Yo, she fire
Brown skin, pretty brown eyes
Slim waist, but her hips kind of wide
Thick thighs, she about 5'5", or about 5'6"
Pretty tits sittin' high, legs crossed when she sit
Hair was hangin' 'bout an inch, then she cut it off (Cut it off)
Eyebrows on fleek, can't rub it off, no pencil
Trap music in the Benz coupe, with the top down
No nigga, just a shih tzu
Bad bitch, she only smoke blunts with the glass tips
And she buy Chanel bags, just to put her cash in
Chanel thigh-high boots, stash the 380 (Stash the 380)
Money on her mind, she ain't thinkin' 'bout no baby (She ain't thinkin' 'bout no baby)
We used to sing Ashanti
"Baby, baby, ba-baby-y"
Now her mood is, "Fuck you, pay me" (Ooh)
Used to ride the bus (Uh), now she wear a bust down (Uh)
Now, it's a Clearport every time she touch down (Uh)
When they throwin' shade, she just make a touchdown (Score)
Scorin' on you hoes, she real life goals
Shorty got her own car and her own crib (Own crib)
She don't take no handouts, she don't owe shit (Ooh, ooh)
Shorty pay her own bills, buy her own drip (Drip, drip)
I can't keep my hands off her, 'cause she so thick (Ooh, ooh)
Bust her wrist down, baby, you the coldest (Ooh, ooh)
She don't gold-dig 'cause it ain't her motive (Yeah, yeah)
She gon' push the drugs just to keep her loaded (Oh-whoa)
Got it out the mud and I had to notice
Shorty ain't never need a nigga
Never, ever need a nigga for nothin' (Never need a nigga for nothin')
Shorty ain't never need a nigga
Never, ever need a nigga for nothin', no (No, never need a nigga)
Shorty ain't never need a nigga
Never, ever, need a nigga for nothin' (She ain't never need a nigga for nothin')
Shorty ain't never need a nigga
Never, ever need a nigga for nothin', no (No, no, never need a nigga)

Shorty, she ain't never need a nigga, no for nothin'
But she so damn precious, my lil' baby, she be splurgin'
Seen her from afar, gettin' money, she be workin'
She a shootin' star, she the one I been searchin' for
She don't need no man (Uh)
A nigga is a dub, can't get no love from her (Ooh)
He don't know her worth (Uh)
Shorty is a queen (Uh)
These hoes can't fuck with her
You might also like
Shorty ain't never need a nigga, she ain't stressin'
Face on godly, body on blessin'
Yeah, she got friends, but her money is her best friend
She already winnin', now she workin' on her next win
Independent women, I salute you
Mami stand out, she ain't neutral
Never goin' broke, she refuse to
New bags, new do, new you
Big body Benz when she cruise through
Out with the old, in with the new new
She'll have you hooked, pussy on voodoo
She'll have you cuckoo for the coo-coo
Gel on her nails, color on Blue's Clues
She stay on vacay, boomerang new views
Playlist with the new tunes
Fuck what ya last nigga did
Baby, do you (Woo)

Shorty got her own car and her own crib (Own crib)
She don't take no handouts, she don't owe shit (Ooh, ooh)
Shorty pay her own bills, buy her own drip (Drip, drip)
I can't keep my hands off her, 'cause she so thick (Ooh, ooh)
Bust her wrist down, baby, you the coldest (Ooh, ooh)
She don't gold-dig 'cause it ain't her motive (Yeah, yeah)
She gon' push the drugs just to keep her loaded (Oh-woah)
Got it out the mud and I had to notice
Shorty ain't never need a nigga
Never, ever need a nigga for nothin' (Never need a nigga for nothin')
Shorty ain't never need a nigga
Never, ever need a nigga for nothin', no (No, never need a nigga)
Shorty ain't never need a nigga
Never, ever need a nigga for nothin' (She ain't never need a nigga for nothin')
Shorty ain't never need a nigga
Never, ever need a nigga for nothin', no (No, no, never need a nigga)2Embed
