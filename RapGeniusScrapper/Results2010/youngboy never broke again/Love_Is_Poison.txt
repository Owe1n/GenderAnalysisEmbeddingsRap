Love Is Poison Lyrics
(CashMoneyAP)
Yeah
And I still ain't found a way to forgive myself
I can never forgive myself

I gave my all to you, this is how you repay me (Yeah)
I put my trust in you, this is how you replace it (Oh)
Your love is poison so no more I can't take it (No more I can't take it)
Can't fuck with you no more because I ain't basic (No)
Being loyal bring you pain (Being loyal bring you pain)
Showin' love will get you hanged (Showin' love will get you hanged)
I won't let 'em end my name, yeah
When you do dirt you get the same, yeah
I already know that I'm a thug, really big B livin' (Yeah)
Get on your ass when you be leavin', you say that I'm trippin' (I'm trippin')
I gave my all to you but you don't care 'cause you don't get it (You don't get it)
I gave my heart to you, you took my shit and ran with it (Ran with it)
Mama told me that she love to see when we together (We together)
I looked and smiled, I ain't tell her you the fuckin' devil
Don't need no gun 'cause when I'm with you, you my heavy metal (Heavy metal)
I hope you never leave my side, separate not ever (On God)
Hope you forgive me for the pain that I brought you (Pain that I brought you)
What's in our blood, only us know about it (Only us know about it)
Don't wanna break up because I can't go without you (Can't go without you)
Your love I ain't never thought about doubtin' (Yeah)
You my thug, I can't lie, you my lil' baby
I'm in jail, I won't be released girl you my affidavit
I don't listen to my niggas, they advice I'm never takin'
If you jump up in that water I dive in for to save you
(Ain't no question)

I gave my all to you, this is how you repay me (Yeah)
I put my trust in you, this is how you replace it (Oh)
Your love is poison so no more I can't take it (No more I can't take it)
Can't fuck with you no more because I ain't basic (Let's go)
You might also like
Every time I feel nobody love me, I come straight to you
Still wanna come lay right on side you when I'm mad at you
I be feelin' like you don't appreciate the shit I do
Argue then you walk off, I ain't ever thought 'bout leavin' you (I ain't ever)
Everything you do I never want another bitch to do (I would never)
My past to the killin' everything I done told to you (I told you)
Damn, still wish we had a baby, why the fuck we can't just be like Kay and Tracey?
They been together 10 years

I gave my heart to you, this how you repay me (This how you repay me)
I put my trust in you, this how you replace it (Yeah)
Your love is poison so no more I can't take it (No more I can't take it)
I fuck with you because together we basic (Together we basic)

Slime, yeah
Straight like that, I don't give a fuck who don't like it
Keep it just like that
