Untouchable Lyrics
I remember I wanted for to quit for so many times
But, I knew this moment'd come, now, it's my time
I got to make up for all them nights that my mama cried
I'm goin' in, I'm puttin' everythin' on the line
Dropped out of school to chase my dream, I had some for to prove
I put my all in this shit, man I can't fuckin' lose
They smile up in my face but they don't know what I been through
Whole lot of nights I went to sleep and I ain't had no food
But now I'm up and I'm just thinking about my next move
Got to keep my head above water, gotta make it through
I do this shit for my mama, and my lil' brother too
Ain't no more problems now I might as well go back to school
Got to maintain, stay on my grind, no, I can't be no fool
Nah, I can't slip, nor I can't fumble, got to stick and move
Get out BR, move to LA, where I ain't got to keep a tool
Surprise, but, I knew my dreams comin' true
We had nothin', stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong, forever right, you know what's up with me, nigga
Never change on my gang, yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable, come run that money up with me, nigga
We had nothin', stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know what's up with me, nigga
Never change on my gang, yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable, come run that money up with me, nigga

Now that I made it ain't nothin' the same, it all changed
When I'm in public people see me they screamin' my name
Just a few days ago I was locked up in them chains
Now I'm in back of the Maybach with a lot of bands
I ain't worry 'bout 'em dissin' now, I don't hear a thing they sayin'
This for my sons and Montana, and can't forget Lil Ben
I never jeopardize this and lose it all again
This for that North 38 Baby, they know I ain't playin'
From the heart, I appreciate all of my fans
This for Monique for loving me and bein' my helpin' hand
I really did it, this for moms, 3Three, Trey and Aaron
Can't nobody tell me nothin', I'm like, "What you sayin'?"

We had nothin', stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know what's up with me, nigga
Never change on my gang, yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me, nigga
We had nothin', stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know what's up with me, nigga
Never change on my gang, yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me, niggaYou might also like23Embed
